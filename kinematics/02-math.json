{"title":"Hitting a Moving Target: The Math of Projectile Motion","link":"./02-math.md","description":"This document delves into the mathematics of projectile motion in 3D environments 🎯. It outlines a method to determine the precise velocity components for a projectile to intercept a moving target 🚀. The setup involves initial positions and velocities of both entities 📍. Key equations are presented, including those for position matching and speed constraints ⏳. Solving these equations yields two possible solutions for velocity 💡. Practical steps for game implementation are included 🎮."}
