# 05-transformer_rl: Transformer RL

## Overview

This book explores the integration of transformer architectures with reinforcement learning (RL) to create advanced decision-making systems. It delves into how attention-based models from transformers can enhance RL agents' ability to process sequential data, improve policy learning, and handle complex environments. The text covers theoretical foundations, implementation strategies, and applications in areas like robotics, game AI, and natural language-based RL.

Essential for AI researchers working on scalable RL systems and large-scale decision-making.
