# Introduction to Large Multimodal Transformer Models and Reinforcement Learning

This chapter provides an introduction to large multimodal transformer models and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, laying the groundwork for the subsequent chapters.  We first review the core concepts of transformer models, focusing on their capabilities for handling diverse modalities.  Then, we introduce fundamental RL principles, emphasizing their role in guiding and optimizing the behavior of large multimodal models.  The chapter concludes by outlining the motivation and structure of the book, highlighting the interconnectedness of these two powerful technologies in the context of real-world applications.
