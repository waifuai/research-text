# 08-multimodal_quantum_llm_for_vision+audio+text_in_qiskit_python: Multimodal Quantum LLM for Vision, Audio, Text in Qiskit Python

## Overview

This book delves into the development of multimodal large language models (LLMs) enhanced by quantum computing principles, focusing on processing visual, audio, and textual data within the Qiskit Python framework. It combines quantum algorithms with traditional machine learning techniques to create more powerful and efficient models capable of understanding and generating multi-modal information. The text provides an in-depth guide to implementing quantum-enhanced multimodal LLMs using Qiskit, covering theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and real-world applications.
