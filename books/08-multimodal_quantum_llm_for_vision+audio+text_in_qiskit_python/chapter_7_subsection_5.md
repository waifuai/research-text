## Subchapter: List of Useful Datasets

This section provides a curated list of datasets suitable for developing and evaluating multimodal quantum language models (QLLMs) focusing on vision, audio, and text in Qiskit Python. These datasets are categorized by modality to facilitate selection based on specific research needs.  Each dataset entry includes a brief description, relevant format information, potential use cases for multimodal QLLMs, and potential Qiskit libraries or tools that might be applicable.

**A. Vision Datasets:**

**B. Audio Datasets:**

| Dataset Name | Description | Format | Potential Use Cases | Relevant Qiskit Tools |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LibriSpeech** | A large dataset of speech audio for speech recognition tasks. | Audio files with transcripts. | Multimodal learning to correlate audio content with other modalities. Potential for audio-to-text generation using QLLMs.| `qiskit.circuit.library` (for potential embedding of audio features), `qiskit.aqua.algorithms.QAOA` (for optimization tasks).|
| **AudioSet** | Large dataset of audio clips labeled by the presence of more than 527 different sounds. | Audio files with labels.| Training of QLLMs to extract and classify different sound cues.  Learning to associate sound features with other modalities.|  `qiskit.circuit.library` (for potential embedding of audio features).|
| **VCTK Corpus** | Speech database of 109 speakers. | Audio files and textual transcriptions. | Multimodal training on speech and text to generate descriptive sentences.| `qiskit.circuit.library` (for potential embedding of audio features).|


**C. Text Datasets:**

| Dataset Name | Description | Format | Potential Use Cases | Relevant Qiskit Tools |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **WikiText-103** | Large text dataset focusing on English language.  | Text files.  | Initial exploration of QLLM capabilities. Fine-tuning multimodal models for textual tasks. | `qiskit.circuit.library` (potential embedding of text features), `qiskit.aqua` (for quantum algorithms that deal with text). |
| **Common Crawl** | Large corpus of text data crawled from the web. | Text files. |  Training large QLLMs to understand real-world web content.| `qiskit.circuit.library` (for potential embedding of text features). |
| **IMDB Dataset** | Sentiment analysis dataset for movie reviews. | Textual reviews with associated sentiment labels.| Multimodal training to combine text information with other modalities (e.g., visual reviews or audio commentary). | `qiskit.circuit.library` (potential embedding of text features).|


**D. Multimodal Datasets:**

| Dataset Name | Description | Format | Potential Use Cases | Relevant Qiskit Tools |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **MSCOCO** | Multimodal dataset including images with captions. | Images with associated text descriptions. | Multimodal QLLM training to generate descriptions for visual data. | `qiskit.circuit.library` (image and text embeddings). |


**Important Considerations:**

* The suitability of a dataset depends on the specific application of the multimodal QLLM.
* Preprocessing steps might be required to transform the data into a format compatible with the proposed Qiskit quantum algorithms.
* The feasibility of applying Qiskit libraries directly to the raw data will depend on its size and complexity.  Quantum circuits will likely need to represent features extracted from the modalities.


This list is not exhaustive and other datasets may be relevant based on the specific research focus. Further exploration and adaptation of existing datasets may be needed for use in Qiskit Python QLLMs.
