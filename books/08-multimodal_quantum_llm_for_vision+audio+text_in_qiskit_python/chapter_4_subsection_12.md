# Quantum Gradient Estimation Techniques

This section delves into the crucial aspect of gradient estimation within the context of quantum language models (LLMs).  As quantum LLMs are often defined by complex, potentially non-differentiable quantum circuits, efficient estimation of gradients is paramount for effective training.  Conventional backpropagation methods are not directly applicable to quantum circuits.  Therefore, specialized techniques are required to compute gradients with respect to the parameters governing the quantum circuits used in the multimodal quantum LLM.
