## What is Qiskit?

Qiskit is an open-source Python framework for working with quantum computers.  It provides a high-level interface for various quantum algorithms, enabling researchers and developers to explore the potential of quantum computing without needing to delve into low-level quantum hardware details.  This abstraction layer makes Qiskit a powerful tool for quantum machine learning applications, allowing users to focus on the machine learning aspects rather than the intricate quantum mechanics involved.

Crucially, Qiskit facilitates the design, implementation, and execution of quantum circuits on both simulators and real quantum hardware. This capability is essential for both developing and testing quantum algorithms, allowing you to gradually move from simulation to actual quantum computation as your understanding grows and resources become available.

Qiskit offers modules for:

* **Quantum circuits:**  Defining and manipulating quantum circuits.
* **Quantum algorithms:** Implementing various quantum algorithms, including those relevant to machine learning tasks.
* **Quantum states:**  Creating and manipulating quantum states.
* **Quantum noise modeling:** Simulating the effects of noise in quantum hardware.
* **Visualization tools:**  Representing and interpreting quantum circuits and results.
* **Quantum computing hardware support:**  Connecting to and interacting with different quantum computers.

By offering a comprehensive and user-friendly set of tools, Qiskit empowers researchers and practitioners to explore and apply quantum computing techniques in various fields, including quantum machine learning.
