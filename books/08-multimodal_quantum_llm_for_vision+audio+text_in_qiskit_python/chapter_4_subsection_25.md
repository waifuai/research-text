## 4. Batch Processing and Parallelization

To improve execution efficiency when dealing with multiple circuits or different input data, batch processing and parallelization strategies should be implemented.

* **Batching Quantum Circuits:** Group related circuits for simultaneous execution.  For example, different steps of the LLM's processing can be grouped into batches.
* **Parallel Execution Frameworks:** Leverage existing Python frameworks like `multiprocessing` or `joblib` to parallelize the circuit execution across multiple CPU cores.

This chapter will include detailed examples, code snippets, and performance benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies in different multimodal LLM scenarios involving vision, audio, and text.
