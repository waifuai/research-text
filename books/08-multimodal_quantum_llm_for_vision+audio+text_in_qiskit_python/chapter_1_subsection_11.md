## Next Steps

After successfully installing Qiskit, we'll move on to exploring its basic functionalities, including quantum circuit construction and basic quantum operations. The subsequent sections of this chapter delve into how to load and prepare vision, audio, and text data in the context of Qiskit, laying the groundwork for our quantum machine learning implementations.
