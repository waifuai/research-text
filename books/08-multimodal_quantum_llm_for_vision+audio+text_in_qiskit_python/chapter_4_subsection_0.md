# Developing the Quantum LLMs

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This chapter delves into the development of Quantum Language Models (LLMs) within the context of multimodal applications.  We outline the essential building blocks required for constructing quantum LLMs capable of processing and understanding vision, audio, and text data simultaneously using Qiskit Python.  Specific focus will be on practical implementation details, including model architectures, data encoding strategies, and quantum circuit design.
