[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This chapter explores the challenges and future directions for multimodal quantum LLMs (large language models) that integrate vision, audio, and text data using Qiskit Python.  We analyze limitations in current approaches, discuss potential avenues for improvement, and outline promising research directions to expand the capabilities and applications of these systems.
