# Multimodal Vision-Audio-Text Tasks

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This chapter explores multimodal vision-audio-text tasks within the context of quantum-enhanced large language models (LLMs).  We detail how to leverage Qiskit Python to address challenges in integrating visual, auditory, and textual data for complex understanding and reasoning.  Specific techniques and architectures for multimodal processing using quantum principles are presented, along with code examples demonstrating practical applications.
