# Introduction to Quantum Machine Learning with Qiskit

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This chapter introduces the foundational concepts of quantum machine learning (QML) using Qiskit, a crucial toolkit for leveraging quantum computing in multimodal applications.  We'll explore how Qiskit facilitates the implementation of quantum algorithms and circuits, setting the stage for subsequent chapters focusing on vision, audio, and text processing within a quantum language model framework.  Key QML principles and relevant Qiskit functionalities will be demonstrated, preparing readers to build and utilize quantum models in a multimodal context.
