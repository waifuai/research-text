# Building a Multimodal Quantum Neural Network

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This chapter details the construction of a multimodal quantum neural network (QNN) for processing vision, audio, and text data within the Qiskit Python framework.  We will explore the encoding strategies for diverse modalities and the design of a unified quantum architecture capable of handling these heterogeneous inputs.  Specific implementations and considerations for efficient data preprocessing and model training will be discussed.
