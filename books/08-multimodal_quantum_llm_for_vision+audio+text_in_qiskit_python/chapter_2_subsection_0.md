# Understanding Vision, Audio, and Text Data

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of vision, audio, and text data, crucial for building multimodal quantum LLMs.  We explore the representation of these modalities, focusing on how they are typically encoded for machine learning tasks, particularly within the context of Qiskit Python.  Understanding these data types is foundational for constructing efficient and effective quantum models that can process and learn from diverse information sources.
