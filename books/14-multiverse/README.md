# 14-multiverse: Multiverse

## Overview

This book explores the concept of the multiverse—multiple, potentially infinite universes—through the lens of theoretical physics and computational modeling. It investigates the implications of multiverse theories for computation, quantum computing, and reality simulation, drawing from cosmology, quantum mechanics, and string theory. The text covers mathematical frameworks for modeling multiverses, computational approaches to simulating parallel realities, and philosophical implications of what a multiverse means for computation and human understanding.

Appealing to physicists, philosophers, computer scientists, and theorists interested in the foundational nature of reality and computation.
