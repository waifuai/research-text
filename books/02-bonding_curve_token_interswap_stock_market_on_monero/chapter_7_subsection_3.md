    * **Order book depth:**  Tracking the number of outstanding buy and sell orders.
    * **Network bandwidth usage:**  Tracking network traffic during peak periods.
    * **CPU and memory utilization:**  Monitoring resource consumption across the nodes.
    * **Error rates:**  Tracking any errors or exceptions during processing.
4. **Load Threshold Identification:**  The stress test continued until the system demonstrated significant performance degradation or unacceptably high error rates. This identified the load threshold where the system struggled to maintain acceptable performance.
5. **Analysis and Optimization:**  Detailed analysis of the metrics from each stage was conducted to pinpoint specific bottlenecks and limitations. This included examining the impact of different trading strategies and network conditions.
6. **Remediation and Retesting:**  Based on the analysis, remedial actions were implemented, such as optimizing database queries, improving network handling, or adding caching mechanisms. The entire stress test procedure was then repeated to validate the effectiveness of the changes.

**7.2.3 Results and Discussion**

Detailed results of the stress tests, including graphs illustrating the relationship between transaction volume and performance metrics, will be presented.  The observed thresholds and limitations will be clearly documented.  Furthermore, the effectiveness of the implemented optimization strategies will be assessed and quantified. The discussion will address the system's robustness and scalability under high-volume conditions, considering the potential implications for real-world deployments.


This section provides a comprehensive overview of the stress testing methodology employed. The detailed results and analysis will be presented in subsequent sections, allowing for a thorough understanding of the system's performance under simulated high-volume conditions.
