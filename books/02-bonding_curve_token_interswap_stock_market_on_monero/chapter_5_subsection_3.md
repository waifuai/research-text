## Chapter 5: Stock Market Integration - Subchapter 2: Data Structures and Data Management

This section details the data structures and management systems crucial for the functioning of the Bonding Curve Token Interswap Stock Market on Monero.  Efficient data handling is paramount for real-time price discovery, order processing, and overall market stability.  This section will cover the data models, storage mechanisms, and query strategies employed.

**5.2.1 Data Models:**

The core data structures underpinning the stock market are designed with performance and security in mind.  They are built upon a decentralized ledger architecture, minimizing single points of failure and ensuring data integrity.

* **Stock Listing:**  This structure holds fundamental information about each tradable stock.  Fields include:
    * `stock_id` (unique identifier, cryptographic hash):  Ensures unambiguous referencing.
    * `ticker_symbol` (alphanumeric string):  Concise representation for user display.
    * `company_name` (string): Full legal name of the company.
    * `security_type` (enum):  Specific classification of the stock (e.g., common, preferred).
    * `initial_price` (decimal):  Initial price assigned at listing.
    * `issuance_details` (array): Information pertaining to the creation and distribution of the underlying tokens.
    * `monero_address` (string):  Address for depositing/withdrawing stock tokens, ensuring segregation of funds from other market functions.
    * `active` (boolean): Flag indicating the stock's trading status.
* **Order Book:**  A key component for price discovery and order matching.  Each entry is constructed as follows:
    * `order_id` (unique identifier, cryptographic hash):  Ensures uniqueness and immutability.
    * `stock_id` (reference to Stock Listing):  Specifies the relevant stock.
    * `order_type` (enum):  Buy or Sell order.
    * `order_quantity` (integer):  The number of shares desired.
    * `price` (decimal):  The desired price per share.
    * `order_time` (timestamp):  Record of when the order was placed.
    * `user_address` (string):  Monero address associated with the order.
    * `order_status` (enum):  Open, Filled, Canceled, etc.
    * `remaining_quantity` (integer): Dynamically updated quantity remaining.
* **Trade History:**  Captures all executed trades.  Fields include:
    * `trade_id` (unique identifier, cryptographic hash):  Uniqueness and traceability.
    * `order_id_buy` (reference to Order Book):  ID of the buying order.
    * `order_id_sell` (reference to Order Book):  ID of the selling order.
    * `trade_quantity` (integer):  Number of shares exchanged.
    * `trade_price` (decimal):  Price at which the trade occurred.
    * `trade_time` (timestamp):  Record of the trade's execution time.
    * `user_address_buy` and `user_address_sell` (string):  Monero addresses of the parties involved.

**5.2.2 Storage Mechanisms:**

Data is stored using a combination of techniques optimized for scalability and security.

* **Decentralized Data Structures:** Leveraging Monero's blockchain for storing immutable trade history and key market parameters ensures trustlessness and transparency.
* **Sharded Database:** The order book and trade history are managed using a sharded database architecture. This distribution across nodes ensures that no single point of failure exists and scales with increasing market activity.
* **Merkle Trees:**  Used for efficient verification of data integrity and reduced storage footprint.

**5.2.3 Data Querying:**

The market's querying system is crucial for real-time data retrieval.

* **Optimized Queries:**  Query engines are designed for rapid retrieval of specific data points (e.g., current price, order book snapshots, trade history for a given stock).
* **Indexing:**  Appropriate indexing mechanisms (e.g., on `stock_id`, `order_type`, `price`) speed up query performance.
* **API Endpoints:**  Well-defined API endpoints facilitate efficient external access to market data for clients and applications.

**5.2.4 Security Considerations:**

Security is paramount to prevent malicious activity.

* **Cryptographic Hashing:**  Ensures the integrity and immutability of all stored data.
* **Access Control:**  Restricted access based on user roles and permissions.
* **Data Validation:** Input validation to prevent injection attacks and ensure data consistency.
