This chapter lays the foundational groundwork for understanding how quantum computing can be leveraged for general-purpose artificial intelligence.  We will explore the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, quantum information, and quantum algorithms, setting the stage for subsequent chapters that delve into specific applications and challenges.  Familiarity with classical computing and AI concepts will prove helpful but is not strictly required.
