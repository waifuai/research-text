Chapter 7: Challenges and Future Directions

This chapter examines the significant hurdles currently facing the application of quantum computing to general-purpose artificial intelligence (AGI).  We will explore limitations in current quantum hardware, algorithmic design, and the fundamental theoretical underpinnings of quantum-enhanced AGI.  Addressing these challenges is crucial for realizing the full potential of quantum computing in this domain, ultimately paving the way for future research and development.
