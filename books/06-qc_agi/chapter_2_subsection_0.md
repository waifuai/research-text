Chapter 2 explores quantum representations for data and features, a crucial step toward leveraging quantum computing for general-purpose artificial intelligence.  We introduce key quantum data structures, including qubit encoding schemes and quantum feature maps, outlining their potential advantages over classical representations in terms of dimensionality, expressiveness, and computational efficiency.  This chapter lays the foundation for subsequent chapters by demonstrating how quantum mechanics can be harnessed to represent and process complex data in novel ways.
