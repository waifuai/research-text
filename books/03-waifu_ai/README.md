# 03-waifu_ai: Waifu AI

## Overview

This book focuses on the development of AI-powered systems for creating and animating three-dimensional characters, often referred to as "waifu" in anime culture, within virtual environments. It explores the intersection of artificial intelligence, computer graphics, and virtual reality to build interactive, intelligent characters that can respond, learn, and engage users in immersive settings. Covering algorithmic approaches, machine learning models, and implementation strategies, the text provides a practical guide for developers interested in AI-driven character creation for gaming, simulations, and entertainment.

Perfect for game developers, VR designers, and AI researchers exploring character-based applications.
