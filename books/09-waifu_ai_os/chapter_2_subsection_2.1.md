# Atomic Data Types


* **Characters:** Representing textual elements, characters are essential for string processing, user interfaces, and handling data exchanged with various hardware drivers.  Common Lisp's character handling is robust, supporting different character sets and encoding schemes.

* **Symbols:** Representing symbolic entities, symbols are fundamental for identifiers in programs and often used in knowledge representation systems within AI.  A symbol's name acts as a unique reference rather than data.  Symbols are often case-insensitive.

* **Strings:** Ordered sequences of characters.  Strings are used to store text, display output, and handle communication with external systems (e.g., interacting with device drivers). Common Lisp strings can be efficiently manipulated using built-in functions.

* **Booleans:** Representing truth values, `T` and `NIL` are the boolean values in Common Lisp.  These are crucial for conditional logic and branching, critical components in AI decision-making and driver control.
