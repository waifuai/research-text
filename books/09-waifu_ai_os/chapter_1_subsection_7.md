# Getting Started with the Project

## 1.7 Getting Started with the Waifu AI OS Project

This section provides a straightforward guide to setting up and running your first Waifu AI OS environment.  This introduction assumes a basic understanding of Common Lisp and its environment, including how to load and run code.  If you are unfamiliar with Common Lisp, consult Appendix A for a quick primer.

**1.7.1 Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* **A compatible Common Lisp implementation:**  The project is built to be highly portable, and should run on any platform supporting a modern Common Lisp implementation.  Recommended implementations include SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp), CCL (Clozure Common Lisp), and ECL (Embeddable Common Lisp).  Installation instructions for these implementations are available on their respective websites.
* **A text editor or IDE:**  A text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is essential for writing and modifying Lisp code.  Common choices include Emacs, VS Code (with the necessary Common Lisp extensions), and Atom.
* **Access to a development environment:**  This could range from a standard desktop computer to a networked development environment. Mobile deployment instructions are covered in a subsequent section.

**1.7.2 Cloning the Repository**

The Waifu AI OS project is hosted as an open-source repository on GitHub, allowing for collaborative development and distribution. To begin, navigate to the project's repository using your command line interface, and clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/WaifuAI-OS.git
```

Replace `your-username` with the actual username from the GitHub repository.  This will download the source code into a new directory named "WaifuAI-OS".

**1.7.3 Project Structure Overview**

The directory structure is designed for modularity and maintainability:

* `src/`: Contains the core Common Lisp source code for the OS, organized into functional modules.  This will include initial implementations for the AI layer, driver interface, and core OS functionalities.
* `tests/`:  Unit tests for components of the OS.  These tests are crucial for development and maintenance.  Contributing to testing is encouraged!
* `docs/`:  This directory contains the documentation, including this guide and more in-depth information.
* `examples/`:  Demonstrates practical applications of Waifu AI OS functionalities with a focus on simplicity.
* `drivers/`:  Contains driver interfaces and modules needed for various hardware integrations.


**1.7.4 Initial Setup and Execution**

To run the basic project structure:

1. **Navigate to the project directory:** Open your terminal and change the directory to the "WaifuAI-OS" directory you cloned.

2. **Load the core code:**  Load the primary Common Lisp file, likely named something like `main.lisp` or `waifu-os.lisp`, using your Common Lisp environment's interpreter.  Instructions vary by implementation, but will typically involve a command like:

   ```lisp
   (load "src/main.lisp")
   ```

3. **Run initial examples:** Once loaded, experiment with initial examples provided in the `examples/` directory.  This ensures that the basic structure and fundamental functionalities are working as expected.


**1.7.5 Further Development**

This initial setup is a stepping stone.  The following steps are important for continued development and deployment:

* **Driver Integration:**  Contribute to the `drivers/` directory to add support for new devices and hardware.
* **AI Integration:** The `src/ai` directory will need further development.  This is where you extend and integrate various AI components.
* **Testing:**  Thorough testing is essential.  Using the included test cases is the best way to identify potential errors early.


This chapter offers a brief overview; a complete guide for advanced and specific functionalities is available in subsequent chapters. Remember to consult the online documentation for any specific troubleshooting or installation issues.
