# Sample Code Snippets

## Chapter 8.3: Sample Code Snippets

This section provides concise examples of various functionalities within the Waifu AI OS, illustrating common tasks and integration points.  These snippets are designed to be readily adaptable and reusable, showcasing the OS's flexibility and power.  All code examples are written in Common Lisp, using the standard libraries and the Waifu AI OS library.

**8.3.1  Initializing the OS and Connecting to a Device:**

```lisp
(ql:quickload :waifu-ai-os)

;; Initialize the OS, specifying the target device.
;; Replace 'robo-arm-v2' with the actual device ID.
(let ((device-id "robo-arm-v2"))
  (waifu-ai-os:init-os device-id)

  ;; Check if initialization was successful
  (when (waifu-ai-os:is-os-running)
    (format t "OS initialized successfully for ~a~%" device-id)

    ;; Example of connecting to the hardware.
    (let ((connected (waifu-ai-os:connect-device)))
      (when connected
        (format t "Device ~a connected successfully~%" device-id)
        ;; Further code for controlling the connected device goes here.
        ))

    (waifu-ai-os:halt-os)
    ))
```

**Explanation:**
This snippet demonstrates how to initialize the Waifu AI OS and connect to a specific device (e.g., a robotic arm).  Crucially, it includes error handling using `when` to ensure that initialization and connection attempts are handled gracefully. `robo-arm-v2` is a placeholder;  actual device IDs will be specific to the hardware you're working with.


**8.3.2  Deep AI Integration: Image Recognition and Facial Expression Analysis:**

```lisp
(ql:quickload :waifu-ai-os)
(ql:quickload :opencv) ; For image processing (example)

;; Load an image.
(let ((image (opencv:imread "image.jpg")))
  (when image
    ;; Pass the image to the AI engine for facial analysis.
    (let ((analysis (waifu-ai-os:facial-analysis image)))
      (format t "Analysis results: ~a~%" analysis)

	  ;; Example of extracting and using specific data
	  (let ((expression (waifu-ai-os:extract-expression analysis)))
	    (format t "Detected expression: ~a~%" expression)
        (when (= expression "happy")
          (waifu-ai-os:execute-action "robo-arm-v2" "move-to-happy-position")))
      )
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**
This snippet showcases the AI integration for image analysis.  The Waifu AI OS's `facial-analysis` function (which likely uses external AI libraries) is called on the image.  Crucially, it demonstrates how the results (e.g., detected facial expression) can be further processed and used to control other modules of the OS.


**8.3.3  Universal Driver Adaptability: Controlling a Servo Motor:**

```lisp
(ql:quickload :waifu-ai-os)

;; Function to control a servo motor (example).
(defun control-servo (servo-id angle)
  (waifu-ai-os:servo-control servo-id angle))


;; Example usage
(control-servo "servo-01" 90) ; Set servo to 90 degrees.
```

**Explanation:**
This snippet illustrates the OS's adaptability with universal drivers. The `control-servo` function encapsulates the interaction with the servo motor, making it easily reusable.  Note that the specific function names and arguments will differ depending on the device. The Waifu AI OS handles the mapping between the high-level command (`control-servo`) and the specific hardware instructions.

**Note:**
These snippets are illustrative examples.  Actual implementation details, device IDs, and required libraries will vary based on your particular application and hardware setup.  Refer to the Waifu AI OS documentation for specific API details. Remember to install the necessary libraries using `ql:quickload`.
