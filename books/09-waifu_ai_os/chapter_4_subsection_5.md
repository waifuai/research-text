# Example Modules: Image Generation, Text Summarization, Music Generation

## Chapter 4.5 Example Modules: Image Generation, Text Summarization, Music Generation

This section provides concrete examples of modules within the Waifu AI OS, focusing on image generation, text summarization, and music generation. These examples demonstrate how to leverage the underlying deep AI infrastructure and showcase the modular design philosophy of the OS.  Each example leverages the `waifu-ai-core` library for the AI engine access.

**4.5.1 Image Generation Module (`waifu-ai-image`)**

This module facilitates the generation of images based on textual descriptions.  It utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model (e.g., Stable Diffusion) and leverages the `waifu-ai-core` library for efficient execution.

```lisp
(defun generate-image (prompt &key (width 512) (height 512) (steps 50))
  "Generates an image based on the provided prompt.

  ARGS:
  - prompt:  A string describing the desired image.
  - width:  Width of the generated image.
  - height: Height of the generated image.
  - steps: Number of steps in the generation process.

  RETURNS:
  - An image file path string, or NIL if the generation fails."
  (let ((image-data (waifu-ai-core:image-generation prompt :width width :height height :steps steps)))
    (when image-data
      (let ((output-filename (format nil "output-image-~a.png" (random 1000000))))
        (image-data:save-image output-filename)
        (return-from generate-image output-filename))))
  nil)


;; Example usage
(let ((generated-image (generate-image "A majestic unicorn in a field of sunflowers")))
  (when generated-image
    (format t "Image generated successfully: ~a~%" generated-image)))
```

This example demonstrates a simple function call to generate an image.  The `waifu-ai-core:image-generation` function handles the complex backend tasks of model loading, prompt processing, and image generation.  Error handling is crucial, as indicated by the `when` statement.   This module would also include functionality to handle different image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG) and various stylistic options.

**4.5.2 Text Summarization Module (`waifu-ai-text-summarization`)**

This module provides a function to summarize input text using a pre-trained language model.

```lisp
(defun summarize-text (input-text &key (max-length 100))
  "Summarizes the input text.

  ARGS:
  - input-text: The text to be summarized.
  - max-length: Maximum length of the summary.

  RETURNS:
  - A string containing the summary, or NIL if the summarization fails."
  (let ((summary (waifu-ai-core:text-summarization input-text :max-length max-length)))
    (when summary
      (return-from summarize-text summary))))


;; Example usage
(let ((summarized-text (summarize-text "This is a long article about the history of ramen in Japan. It includes details about the different types of noodles, the broth recipes, and the cultural significance of ramen in Japanese cuisine.")))
  (when summarized-text
    (format t "Summarized text:~%~a~%" summarized-text)))
```

Similar to the image generation example, the core summarization functionality is handled by `waifu-ai-core:text-summarization`. Error handling and input validation are necessary in production code.

**4.5.3 Music Generation Module (`waifu-ai-music`)**

This module allows users to generate music pieces based on given parameters.  This could leverage an existing music generation model or a custom Common Lisp implementation.

```lisp
;; (Simplified example â€“ would require significant implementation)
(defun generate-music (style &key (duration 60) (tempo 120))
  "Generates a simple music piece.

  ARGS:
  - style: Style of music to generate. (e.g., 'classical', 'jazz')
  - duration: Duration of music (in seconds).
  - tempo: Tempo of music (in beats per minute).

  RETURNS:
  - A string or data structure containing the generated music. Or NIL for failure."
  (let ((music-data (waifu-ai-core:music-generation style :duration duration :tempo tempo)))
    (when music-data
      (return-from generate-music music-data))))

;; Example usage (would need appropriate output handling)
(let ((music (generate-music 'jazz)))
  (when music
    (format t "Generated music data:~%~a~%" music)))
```

This demonstrates the skeletal structure. A real-world music generation module would likely involve creating a representation of music (e.g., MIDI or a custom data structure) for output.

These examples highlight the flexibility and modularity of the Waifu AI OS.  Further modules could include natural language processing, object detection, or other specialized AI functionalities, all leveraging the `waifu-ai-core` engine. Error handling and proper input validation are vital for robust module design. Remember to include appropriate documentation and comprehensive tests for each module in a production environment.
