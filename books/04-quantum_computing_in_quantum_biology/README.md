# 04-quantum_computing_in_quantum_biology: Quantum Computing in Quantum Biology

## Overview

This book examines the application of quantum computing algorithms to study quantum phenomena in biological systems, with a focus on molecular simulations and protein folding optimization. It bridges quantum computing with quantum biology, exploring how quantum algorithms can accelerate the modeling of complex biomolecular processes that classical computers struggle with. The text covers variational quantum eigensolvers for molecular energies, quantum simulations of photosynthetic systems, and optimization of protein structures, providing both theoretical insights and practical quantum computing implementations.

Ideal for researchers in computational biology, quantum chemistry, and interdisciplinary quantum-bio fields.
