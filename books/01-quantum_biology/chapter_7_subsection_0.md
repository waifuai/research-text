Chapter 7: Applications and Future Directions

This chapter summarizes potential applications of quantum phenomena in biological systems and explores avenues for future research.  Drawing upon the foundational principles established throughout this volume, we examine how quantum effects may underpin a range of biological processes and discuss emerging technologies with the potential to advance our understanding of these phenomena.  Finally, we outline promising avenues for future investigation, including novel experimental approaches and theoretical frameworks.
