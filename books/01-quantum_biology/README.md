# 01-quantum_biology: Quantum Biology

## Overview

This book explores quantum phenomena in biological systems, focusing on the role of quantum mechanics in cellular processes, biomolecular interactions, and life functions. It examines how quantum principles like superposition, entanglement, and coherence manifest in biological contexts, challenging classical views of biology. Through computational models and experimental insights, the text investigates quantum effects in photosynthesis, enzyme catalysis, DNA mutation, and sensory systems, providing a foundation for quantum biology research.

Suitable for biophysicists, quantum physicists, and interdisciplinary researchers interested in the quantum-classical boundary in life sciences.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Fundamental Quantum Biology Concepts**: Wave-particle duality in biological systems, decoherence in warm environments.
- **Photosynthesis and Energy Transfer**: Quantum coherence in light harvesting complexes.
- **Enzyme Catalysis**: Quantum tunneling in enzymatic reactions.
- **DNA and Genetic Information**: Quantum effects in mutation and replication.
- **Sensory Systems**: Quantum vision in birds and insects.
- **Computational Modeling**: Simulating quantum biological systems.
- **Challenges and Open Questions**: Experimental detection and implications for medicine.
