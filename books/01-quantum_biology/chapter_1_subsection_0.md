This chapter provides a foundational overview of quantum biology, focusing on the key principles and concepts that underpin the field.  Building upon the groundwork laid in previous volumes, we will explore the theoretical framework, highlighting crucial concepts like quantum coherence, entanglement, and tunneling, and their potential relevance to biological systems.  We will also discuss the experimental approaches used to detect and characterize these quantum phenomena, setting the stage for the subsequent chapters' exploration of specific biological applications.
