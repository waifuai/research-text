Chapter 6 explores the burgeoning field of quantum effects in protein folding and function.  While classical mechanics adequately describes many aspects of protein behavior, recent research highlights the crucial role of quantum phenomena in key biological processes, including the initial folding steps, substrate binding, and catalysis.  This chapter examines the evidence for and mechanisms of quantum effects within proteins, considering both theoretical models and experimental findings.
