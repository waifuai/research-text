Chapter 4 delves into the crucial role of electron transfer processes in quantum biological systems.  We examine the interplay between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom, emphasizing the quantum mechanical nature of these dynamics, which are often non-adiabatic and exhibit coherence.  This chapter explores theoretical frameworks and experimental evidence supporting the importance of quantum effects in biological electron transfer, setting the stage for subsequent discussions on specific examples.
