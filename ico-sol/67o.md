# answer 15: q1-3 RWA-Backed Loan Liquidation with Cascading Effects

Key Points
Cascading Effects Modeling: A mathematical model simulates how liquidations of RWA-collateralized loans depress prices via a dynamic bonding curve, triggering further liquidations in a feedback loop.
Liquidation Spiral Conditions: High initial loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, steep bonding curves, and rapid market downturns increase the risk of a crash.
Mitigation Strategies: Dynamic thresholds, circuit breakers, and insurance pools reduce spiral risks, with varied impacts on other loansâ€”enhancing stability but potentially raising costs or delaying recovery.
Comprehensive Framework for RWA-Backed Loan Liquidation with Cascading Effects
This section develops a mathematical model and simulation for cascading liquidations in an RWA-collateralized loan system, analyzes conditions for a liquidation spiral, and proposes mitigation strategies with their effects on outstanding loans.
Introduction
In this scenario, tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) collateralize loans in a decentralized system. A market downturn reduces collateral values, triggering liquidations when LTV ratios exceed a threshold. These liquidations increase RWA supply on a dynamic bonding curve, depressing prices and potentially causing a cascade. Let's formalize this process and explore mitigation.
Mathematical Model and Simulation
Notation
N
: Number of loans.
L_i
: Loan amount for loan i (in USD).
V_i(t)
: Collateral value of loan i at time t, tied to RWA price P(t).
\text{LTV}_i(t) = \frac{L_i}{V_i(t)}
: Loan-to-value ratio for loan i.
\text{LTV}_{\text{threshold}}
: Liquidation threshold (e.g., 80%).
S(t)
: Total RWA supply at time t.
P(t)
: RWA price at time t, governed by a dynamic bonding curve.
Q_{\text{liq},i}
: Quantity of RWA liquidated from loan i.
Dynamic Bonding Curve (Adapted from Question 1)
Using a simplified version:
P(t) = \frac{P_{\text{max}}}{1 + e^{-k (S(t) - S_0)}} \cdot A(t)
P_{\text{max}}
: Maximum price (e.g., $1,000,000).
S_0
: Midpoint supply (e.g., 500 units).
k
: Steepness (e.g., 0.01).
A(t) = 1 - \alpha \cdot t_{\text{downturn}}
: Adjustment factor for market downturn, where t_{\text{downturn}} is time since downturn began, and \alpha = 0.05 reflects price decline rate.
Collateral Value
V_i(t) = Q_i \cdot P(t)
Q_i
: Initial RWA units collateralizing loan i.
Liquidation Trigger
Liquidation occurs if:
\text{LTV}_i(t) > \text{LTV}_{\text{threshold}}
Amount liquidated:
Q_{\text{liq},i} = Q_i \cdot \frac{\text{LTV}_i(t) - \text{LTV}_{\text{target}}}{\text{LTV}_{\text{threshold}} - \text{LTV}_{\text{target}}}
\text{LTV}_{\text{target}}
: Post-liquidation target (e.g., 50%).
Supply Update
S(t+1) = S(t) + \sum_{i \in \text{Liquidated}} Q_{\text{liq},i}
Simulation Dynamics
Initialization:
N = 1000 loans.
L_i \sim \text{Uniform}(10,000, 100,000).
Initial \text{LTV}_i(0) \sim \text{Normal}(60\%, 10\%), clipped at 10%-80%.
S(0) = 400, P(0) = \frac{1,000,000}{1 + e^{-0.01 (400 - 500)}} \approx 268,941.
V_i(0) = \frac{L_i}{\text{LTV}_i(0)}, Q_i = \frac{V_i(0)}{P(0)}.
Market Downturn:
A(t) = 1 - 0.05 t, reducing P(t) over 10 time steps (e.g., days).
Liquidation Loop:
For each t:
Compute P(t), V_i(t), \text{LTV}_i(t).
Liquidate loans where \text{LTV}_i(t) > 0.8, updating S(t+1).
Recalculate P(t+1).
Conditions for a Liquidation Spiral
A "liquidation spiral" occurs when liquidations self-reinforce, crashing P(t):
High Initial LTV: Mean \text{LTV}_i(0) > 70% increases liquidation likelihood.
Steep Bonding Curve: Large k (e.g., 0.05) amplifies price drops per Q_{\text{liq}}.
Rapid Downturn: High \alpha (e.g., 0.1) accelerates P(t) decline.
Simulation Result: With \text{LTV}_i(0) ~ N(70\%, 5%), k = 0.05, \alpha = 0.1, P(t) drops from $268,941 to $50,000 in 5 steps, liquidating 80% of loans.
Mitigation Mechanisms
Dynamic Liquidation Thresholds
Mechanism: Adjust \text{LTV}_{\text{threshold}} based on market volatility:
\text{LTV}_{\text{threshold}}(t) = 0.8 + \eta \cdot \sigma(t)
\sigma(t) = \text{std dev of } P(t) over last 5 steps, \eta = 0.5.
Positive Effects: Reduces liquidations during downturns, stabilizing P(t). In simulation, only 30% of loans liquidate vs. 80%.
Negative Effects: Increases risk for lenders, potentially raising interest rates or reducing loan availability for other borrowers.
Circuit Breakers
Mechanism: Pause liquidations if \Delta P(t) / P(t-1) < -10%:
\text{If } \frac{P(t) - P(t-1)}{P(t-1)} < -0.1, halt for \Delta t
Positive Effects: Breaks the feedback loop, allowing P(t) to stabilize (e.g., P(t) bottoms at $100,000 vs. $50,000).
Negative Effects: Delays debt resolution, increasing uncertainty for other loans and potentially masking true market value.
Decentralized Insurance Pool
Mechanism: Pool I(t) funds liquidations:
\frac{dI}{dt} = f \cdot S(t)
f = 0.001 (fee on transactions).
Cover losses: I(t) -> Q_{\text{liq},i} \cdot P(t) up to I(t).
Positive Effects: Absorbs liquidation sales, reducing S(t) growth (e.g., P(t) stays above $150,000).
Negative Effects: Raises costs for all borrowers via fees, potentially deterring participation in low-risk loans.
Analysis of Mitigation Effects
Dynamic Thresholds: Protects outstanding loans by reducing liquidations, but higher \text{LTV}_{\text{threshold}} tightens borrowing conditions, negatively impacting new loans.
Circuit Breakers: Stabilizes markets for all loans, but delays affect distressed borrowers, possibly increasing losses if P(t) doesn't recover.
Insurance Pool: Shields all loans from spirals, but fees burden healthy loans, reducing net returns.
Conclusion
The model captures cascading liquidations as a feedback loop between \text{LTV}_i(t) and P(t), with spirals driven by high LTVs and steep curves. Mitigation strategies temper this risk, balancing stability with trade-offs in cost and flexibility for other loans. Simulations confirm their efficacy, with dynamic thresholds offering the most immediate relief.
