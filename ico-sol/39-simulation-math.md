# affiliate 

The user wants to translate the provided Python code, which simulates a token economy with bonding curves and affiliates, into a mathematical problem statement and solution. Here's a breakdown of the thinking process:

1. **Identify the Core Components:** The first step is to recognize the key elements of the simulation that need mathematical representation. These are:
    * **Tokens:** Their price and supply dynamics.
    * **Bonding Curves:** The mathematical relationship defining the token price based on supply.
    * **Affiliates:** Their actions (buying/selling tokens), commission, and base currency balance.
    * **Simulation Steps:** The iterative process of the simulation.

2. **Define Notation:** Assign mathematical symbols to the variables in the code. This makes the problem statement concise and understandable. For example:
    * $S_i(t)$: Supply of token $i$ at time $t$.
    * $P_i(t)$: Price of token $i$ at time $t$.
    * $B_i(S_i(t))$: Bonding curve function for token $i$.
    * $C_j(t)$: Commission rate of affiliate $j$ at time $t$.
    * $W_{j,i}(t)$: Wallet balance of token $i$ for affiliate $j$ at time $t$.
    * $B_j(t)$: Base currency balance of affiliate $j$ at time $t$.

3. **Formulate the Problem Statement:**  Clearly state the objective of the problem. In this case, it's about modeling the dynamics of the token economy and analyzing the outcomes. This involves describing the key entities and their initial states.

4. **Mathematical Formulation of Key Mechanics:**  This is the most crucial part. Translate the Python logic into mathematical equations:
    * **Bonding Curve:** Express the price determination using the chosen bonding curve function. Acknowledge that the specific function can change over time.
    * **Buying Tokens:**  Define how buying affects token supply and affiliate balances.
    * **Selling Tokens:** Define how selling affects token supply and affiliate balances.
    * **Commission:**  Represent the calculation of commission earned by affiliates.
    * **Dynamic Commission Adjustment:**  This is slightly more complex as it depends on past behavior. Use logical conditions or a piecewise function to describe the adjustment.
    * **Simulation Update Rules:** Express how the variables change from one time step to the next.

5. **Solution Approach:**  Describe the methodology used to solve the problem, which is a discrete-time simulation. Highlight the iterative nature of the process.

6. **Analysis:** Explain what kind of analysis can be performed on the simulation results, such as calculating means, standard deviations, and visualizing trends.

7. **Markdown Formatting:** Use appropriate Markdown syntax to structure the document, including headings, bullet points, and LaTeX for equations. Use `$` for inline equations and `$$` for displayed equations.

8. **Review and Refine:** Check the mathematical formulation for accuracy and clarity. Ensure the notation is consistent and the explanations are easy to understand. For instance, initially, I might have just said "price is a function of supply." But refining this to $P_i(t) = f_i(S_i(t), \theta_i(t))$ makes it clearer that the function *and* its parameters can change.

**Self-Correction/Improvements during the process:**

* **Initial thought:**  Simply list the bonding curve functions.
* **Improvement:**  Explicitly state the general form and then list the specific examples. This provides better context.
* **Initial thought:** Describe the commission adjustment vaguely.
* **Improvement:** Use conditional statements or piecewise notation to represent the different scenarios for commission adjustments based on earnings.
* **Initial thought:** Focus solely on the equations.
* **Improvement:** Include descriptions of the parameters and variables to make the mathematical formulation more accessible.
* **Initial thought:**  Treat all affiliates the same.
* **Improvement:** Acknowledge the presence of "whales" and their potentially different behavior (though the provided mathematical formulation doesn't explicitly model their special rules, the Python code does). This acknowledges a nuance in the simulation.

By following these steps, the Python code can be effectively translated into a rigorous mathematical problem statement and solution. The use of LaTeX ensures that the mathematical expressions are correctly rendered in GitHub Markdown. document presents a mathematical formulation of a simulated token economy involving tokens with dynamic bonding curves and affiliates earning commissions.

**Problem Statement:**

Consider a system with $N$ distinct tokens and $M$ affiliates interacting over discrete time steps $t = 0, 1, 2, \dots, T$. Each token $i \in \{1, \dots, N\}$ has a supply $S_i(t)$ and a price $P_i(t)$ at time $t$. The price of each token is determined by a bonding curve function $f_i$, which can change over time. Specifically, the price depends on the current supply and possibly time-varying parameters $\theta_i(t)$:

$$P_i(t) = f_i(S_i(t), \theta_i(t))$$

The bonding curve function $f_i$ can be one of several predefined functions (e.g., linear, exponential, sigmoid, root, inverse), and the specific function used for token $i$ can change at discrete intervals. The parameters $\theta_i(t)$ associated with the active bonding curve function can also change at discrete intervals.

Each affiliate $j \in \{1, \dots, M\}$ has a base currency balance $B_j(t)$, a wallet holding balances of each token $W_{j,i}(t)$ for token $i$, and a commission rate $C_j(t)$.

At each time step, affiliates can perform buy or sell transactions for each token. When affiliate $j$ buys $\Delta s$ units of token $i$ at time $t$, the following occurs:

1. The cost of the transaction is $\Delta s \cdot P_i(t)$.
2. The affiliate's base currency balance decreases: $B_j(t+1) = B_j(t) - \Delta s \cdot P_i(t)$.
3. The affiliate's wallet balance of token $i$ increases: $W_{j,i}(t+1) = W_{j,i}(t) + \Delta s$.
4. The token's supply increases: $S_i(t+1) = S_i(t) + \Delta s$.
5. The token's price is recalculated based on the new supply and the current bonding curve.

When affiliate $j$ sells $\Delta s$ units of token $i$ at time $t$:

1. The proceeds from the sale are $\Delta s \cdot P_i(t)$.
2. The affiliate's base currency balance increases: $B_j(t+1) = B_j(t) + \Delta s \cdot P_i(t)$.
3. The affiliate's wallet balance of token $i$ decreases: $W_{j,i}(t+1) = W_{j,i}(t) - \Delta s$.
4. The token's supply decreases: $S_i(t+1) = S_i(t) - \Delta s$.
5. The token's price is recalculated.

Affiliates earn commissions based on some measure of their activity (not explicitly modeled in the provided code snippet for direct calculation within transactions, but the commission rate exists). The commission rate $C_j(t)$ for affiliate $j$ can dynamically adjust based on their past investment behavior and total earnings. The adjustment follows a set of predefined rules:

- The rate of adjustment is given by a dynamic adjustment rate.
- Adjustments happen at specific time step intervals.
- Commission rates have upper and lower bounds.

The goal is to simulate the evolution of this token economy over time, observing the changes in token prices, supplies, affiliate balances, and commission rates.

**Solution Approach (Simulation):**

The problem is solved through a discrete-time simulation. The simulation proceeds as follows:

1. **Initialization (t=0):**
   - Set initial supplies $S_i(0)$ and prices $P_i(0)$ for each token.
   - Assign initial bonding curve functions $f_i$ and parameters $\theta_i(0)$ for each token.
   - Set initial base currency balances $B_j(0)$, wallet balances $W_{j,i}(0)$, and commission rates $C_j(0)$ for each affiliate.

2. **Iteration (for t = 0 to T-1):**
   - **Affiliate Actions:** For each affiliate $j$, determine their actions for each token $i$ (buy, sell, or do nothing). The amount to buy or sell can be based on predefined strategies or randomness.
   - **Token Transactions:**  Update token supplies and affiliate balances based on the executed buy and sell transactions, applying the rules described in the problem statement.
   - **Price Calculation:** Recalculate the price of each token using its current bonding curve function and supply:
     $$P_i(t+1) = f_i(S_i(t+1), \theta_i(t))$$
     The code includes factors for demand and dampening, which can be incorporated as:
     $$P_i(t+1) = f_i(S_i(t+1), \theta_i(t)) \cdot (1 + \alpha \cdot D_i(t))$$
     where $D_i(t)$ represents a demand factor and $\alpha$ is a sensitivity parameter.
   - **Bonding Curve Changes:** At predefined intervals, the bonding curve function $f_i$ and/or its parameters $\theta_i(t)$ for each token can change according to predefined rules or randomness.
   - **Commission Adjustment:** At predefined intervals, adjust the commission rates $C_j(t)$ for each affiliate based on their past performance (e.g., average investment, total earnings) according to predefined rules and bounds.

3. **Analysis:** After the simulation runs for $T$ steps, analyze the collected data, including:
   - Time series of token prices $P_i(t)$ and supplies $S_i(t)$.
   - Time series of affiliate base currency balances $B_j(t)$ and commission rates $C_j(t)$.
   - Distributions of final balances and commission rates.

**Mathematical Representation of Bonding Curves (Examples):**

The code provides several examples of bonding curve functions:

- **Linear:** $f(S) = m \cdot S + b$
- **Exponential:** $f(S) = a \cdot e^{k \cdot S}$
- **Sigmoid:** $f(S) = \frac{K}{1 + e^{-k(S - S_0)}}$
- **Root:** $f(S) = k \cdot \sqrt{S}$
- **Inverse:** $f(S) = \frac{k}{S + 1}$

The active bonding curve function $f_i$ for token $i$ at time $t$ is chosen from this set and its parameters are updated according to the simulation rules.

**Dynamic Commission Rate Adjustment (Mathematical Description):**

The commission rate $C_j(t)$ for affiliate $j$ is adjusted dynamically. Let $\Delta C_j(t)$ be the change in commission rate at time $t$. The adjustment can be described as:

$$\Delta C_j(t) = \begin{cases}
    +\delta_j & \text{if } \text{condition}_1 \\
    -\delta_j & \text{if } \text{condition}_2 \\
    0           & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

where $\delta_j$ is the dynamic adjustment rate for affiliate $j$, which itself can depend on the affiliate's total earnings. The conditions are based on metrics like average recent investment. The commission rate is also bounded:

$$C_{min} \leq C_j(t) \leq C_{max}$$

**Output and Analysis:**

The simulation generates time series data that can be used to analyze the dynamics of the token economy. This includes:

- **Token Price and Supply Evolution:** Observe how prices and supplies change over time and how they are affected by bonding curve changes and market activity.
- **Affiliate Performance:** Track the growth of affiliate base currency balances and how commission rates evolve.
- **Market Stability:** Analyze the volatility of token prices and the overall stability of the simulated economy.

This mathematical formulation provides a framework for understanding and modeling the complex interactions within the simulated token economy. The simulation, as implemented in the Python code, serves as a computational method for exploring the behavior of this system under different conditions and parameter settings.




# airdrop

The user wants to transform the provided Python code into an unsolved mathematical problem statement and its solution in GitHub Markdown format.

Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Understand the Code:** The Python code simulates a token economy with different airdrop strategies. The goal is to analyze the impact of these strategies on the token price.
2. **Identify Key Variables and Relationships:**  Extract the core mathematical elements: token supply, price, user behavior (buy/sell probabilities), airdrop parameters, and the simulation dynamics.
3. **Formulate the Problem Statement:** Express the simulation as a mathematical model. Define the state variables, parameters, and the objective (e.g., predicting the token price under different airdrop schemes).
4. **Develop the Solution:** Translate the Python code's logic into mathematical equations. Represent user behavior, price dynamics, and airdrop mechanics mathematically.
5. **Structure the Solution in Markdown:** Use GitHub Markdown syntax, especially LaTeX for equations, to present the problem and solution clearly. of $P_0$. The economy consists of $N$ users, each characterized by a set of behavioral parameters influencing their buy and sell decisions. These parameters include a base buy probability ($b$), a base sell probability ($s$), a price sensitivity ($\sigma$), and a market influence ($\mu$). Users are categorized into archetypes, each with a distinct set of these parameters.

The token economy undergoes discrete time steps. At each step, users make buy or sell decisions based on probabilistic models influenced by the current token price ($P_t$), the initial price, a market sentiment factor ($M_t$), and a specific airdrop strategy implemented.

Several airdrop strategies can be employed, each defined by a set of parameters including:

*   **Type:**  (e.g., lottery, uniform, tiered, none)
*   **Percentage:** The fraction of the initial token supply allocated for the airdrop.
*   **Vesting:** The method by which airdropped tokens become available to users (e.g., none, linear, dynamic based on price or activity).
*   **Vesting Periods:** The number of periods over which vesting occurs.
*   **Criteria:** The metric used for eligibility or allocation (e.g., holdings, activity).
*   **Thresholds:**  Levels of the criteria used for tiered airdrops.
*   **Weights:**  Factors applied to different tiers in a tiered airdrop.
*   **Winners Fraction:** The proportion of users selected in a lottery airdrop.
*   **Price Threshold:** A price level used in dynamic price vesting.
*   **Activity Threshold:** An activity level used in dynamic activity vesting.

The probability of a user $i$ buying at time $t$ ($P_{buy, i, t}$) and selling ($P_{sell, i, t}$) are modeled as sigmoid functions:

$P_{buy, i, t} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_{buy, i} + \sigma_i (P_0 - P_t) + \mu_i M_t - \Delta P_t \cdot \omega_{buy})}}$

$P_{sell, i, t} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_{sell, i} - \sigma_i (P_t - P_{airdrop}) + \mu_i M_t + \Delta P_t \cdot \omega_{sell})}}$

where:

*   $\beta_{buy, i}$ and $\beta_{sell, i}$ are base probabilities for user $i$, potentially modified by the airdrop strategy.
*   $P_{airdrop}$ is a reference price, potentially the initial price or a specific price target of the airdrop.
*   $\Delta P_t = \frac{P_t - P_0}{P_0}$ represents the relative price change.
*   $\omega_{buy}$ and $\omega_{sell}$ are weighting factors for the price change influence.

The quantity of tokens bought or sold by user $i$ is influenced by their decision and the available supply or their holdings. The token price at the next time step ($P_{t+1}$) is determined by the aggregate buy and sell orders, assuming a simplified market clearing mechanism where the price adjusts based on the difference between demand and supply relative to the total supply ($S_t$). A burn mechanism is also in place, reducing the total supply based on transaction volume.

**The Problem:**

Given the initial conditions, user archetypes and their parameters, and a defined set of airdrop strategies (characterized by the parameters listed above), mathematically model and predict the evolution of the token price ($P_t$) and total token supply ($S_t$) over a finite number of time steps ($T_{max}$) for each airdrop strategy. Analyze and compare the impact of different airdrop strategies on the final token price and supply.

## Solution:

Let:

*   $T_t$ be the total token supply at time $t$.
*   $P_t$ be the token price at time $t$.
*   $H_{i,t}$ be the holdings of user $i$ at time $t$.
*   $\mathcal{A}$ be the set of user archetypes.
*   $\theta_a = (b_a, s_a, \sigma_a, \mu_a)$ be the parameters for archetype $a \in \mathcal{A}$.
*   $U$ be the set of users, $|U| = N$.
*   $A_i \in \mathcal{A}$ be the archetype of user $i$.
*   $\theta_i = \theta_{A_i}$ be the parameters of user $i$.
*   $\mathcal{S}$ be the set of airdrop strategies.
*   $s \in \mathcal{S}$ be a specific airdrop strategy with parameters $\Pi_s$.
*   $E_{i,s}$ be the eligibility of user $i$ for airdrop strategy $s$.
*   $\Gamma_{i,s}$ be the amount of tokens airdropped to user $i$ under strategy $s$.
*   $V_{i,s,t}$ be the amount of vested tokens for user $i$ under strategy $s$ at time $t$.
*   $\mathbb{I}(\cdot)$ be the indicator function.

**1. User Behavior Model:**

The probability of user $i$ buying at time $t$ under airdrop strategy $s$ is:

$P_{buy, i, t}^{(s)} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\theta_{i,buy} + \sigma_i (P_0 - P_t) + \mu_i M_t - \frac{P_t - P_0}{P_0} \cdot 0.5)}}$

where $\theta_{i,buy}$ is the base buy probability of user $i$.

The probability of user $i$ selling at time $t$ under airdrop strategy $s$ is:

$P_{sell, i, t}^{(s)} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\theta_{i,sell} - \sigma_i (P_t - P_{0}) + \mu_i M_t + \frac{P_t - P_0}{P_0} \cdot 0.3)}} \cdot (1 + \ln(H_{i,t} + 1)) \cdot \mathbb{I}(H_{i,t} > 0)$

where $\theta_{i,sell}$ is the base sell probability of user $i$, potentially modified by the airdrop strategy (e.g., halved for holding-based tiered airdrops).

**2. Airdrop Mechanics:**

The total amount of tokens allocated for airdrop strategy $s$ is $A^{(s)} = T_0 \cdot \text{percentage}^{(s)}$.

*   **Uniform Airdrop:**  $\Gamma_{i,s} = \frac{A^{(s)}}{N}$.
*   **Lottery Airdrop:**  Select $\lfloor N \cdot \text{winners\_fraction}^{(s)} \rfloor$ winners randomly. Airdrop amount per winner is $\frac{A^{(s)}}{\lfloor N \cdot \text{winners\_fraction}^{(s)} \rfloor}$.
*   **Tiered Airdrop:** Eligibility is based on `criteria` (holdings or activity) and `thresholds` with corresponding `weights`. For holdings: $E_{i,s} = \sum_{j} \text{weight}_j^{(s)} \cdot \mathbb{I}(H_{i,0} \ge \text{threshold}_j^{(s)})$. The airdrop amount is proportional to eligibility: $\Gamma_{i,s} = A^{(s)} \cdot \frac{E_{i,s}}{\sum_{k \in U} E_{k,s}}$.
*   **No Airdrop:** $\Gamma_{i,s} = 0$.

**3. Vesting:**

*   **No Vesting:** $V_{i,s,t} = \Gamma_{i,s}$.
*   **Linear Vesting:** $V_{i,s,t} = \Gamma_{i,s} \cdot \frac{\lfloor \frac{t}{\lfloor T_{max} / \text{vesting\_periods}^{(s)} \rfloor} \rfloor}{\text{vesting\_periods}^{(s)}}$.
*   **Dynamic Price Vesting:** $V_{i,s,t} = V_{i,s,t-1} + \frac{\Gamma_{i,s}}{\text{vesting\_periods}^{(s)}} \cdot \mathbb{I}\left(t \mod \lfloor T_{max} / \text{vesting\_periods}^{(s)} \rfloor = 0 \land P_t > \text{price\_threshold}^{(s)}\right)$.
*   **Dynamic Activity Vesting:** $V_{i,s,t} = V_{i,s,t-1} + \frac{\Gamma_{i,s}}{\text{vesting\_periods}^{(s)}} \cdot \mathbb{I}\left(t \mod \lfloor T_{max} / \text{vesting\_periods}^{(s)} \rfloor = 0 \land \text{activity}_i \ge \text{activity\_threshold}^{(s)}\right)$.

**4. Market Dynamics:**

At each time step $t$:

*   **Buy Decisions:** Each user $i$ attempts to buy with probability $P_{buy, i, t}^{(s)}$, attempting to buy an amount $B_{i,t}^{(s)} = \text{Bernoulli}(P_{buy, i, t}^{(s)}) \cdot 50 P_t$.
*   **Sell Decisions:** Each user $i$ attempts to sell with probability $P_{sell, i, t}^{(s)}$, attempting to sell an amount $S_{i,t}^{(s)} = \text{Bernoulli}(P_{sell, i, t}^{(s)}) \cdot H_{i,t}$.
*   **Aggregate Demand:** $D_t^{(s)} = \sum_{i \in U} B_{i,t}^{(s)}$.
*   **Aggregate Supply:** $O_t^{(s)} = \sum_{i \in U} S_{i,t}^{(s)} \cdot P_t$.
*   **Price Change:** $\Delta P_t^{(s)} = \frac{D_t^{(s)} - O_t^{(s)}}{T_t^{(s)}} \cdot \max\left(0.1, \left|\frac{D_t^{(s)} - O_t^{(s)}}{T_t^{(s)}}\right| \cdot 15\right) + \mathcal{N}(0, 0.01)$.
*   **Next Price:** $P_{t+1}^{(s)} = \max(P_t^{(s)} + \Delta P_t^{(s)}, 0.000001)$.
*   **Transactions:** Buy amounts are capped by supply: $B_{i,t,executed}^{(s)} = \min(B_{i,t}^{(s)}, T_t^{(s)} \cdot 0.005)$.
*   **Holdings Update:** $H_{i,t+1}^{(s)} = H_{i,t}^{(s)} + B_{i,t,executed}^{(s)} - S_{i,t}^{(s)} + \frac{V_{i,s,t+1} - V_{i,s,t}}{\text{vesting\_periods}^{(s)}}$.
*   **Transaction Volume:** $Vol_t^{(s)} = \sum_{i \in U} (B_{i,t,executed}^{(s)} + S_{i,t}^{(s)})$.
*   **Supply Burn:** $\Delta T_t^{(s)} = Vol_t^{(s)} \cdot 0.05$.
*   **Next Supply:** $T_{t+1}^{(s)} = T_t^{(s)} - \Delta T_t^{(s)}$.

**5. Market Sentiment:**

Market sentiment evolves stochastically:

$M_{t+1} = \text{clip}(M_t + \mathcal{N}(0, 0.01), -0.5, 0.5)$.

**Simulation:**

For each airdrop strategy $s \in \mathcal{S}$, simulate the token economy for $t = 0, 1, \dots, T_{max}$ using the equations above, starting with initial conditions $T_0$, $P_0$, and initial user holdings (potentially from an initial airdrop). Record the price history $P_t^{(s)}$ and supply history $T_t^{(s)}$ for each strategy.

**Analysis:**

Compare the final token price $P_{T_{max}}^{(s)}$ and final supply $T_{T_{max}}^{(s)}$ across different airdrop strategies to determine the impact of each strategy on the token economy. Identify the strategy that yields the highest final price or achieves other desired outcomes. Visualize the price trajectories for different strategies.


# bonding curve

The user wants to translate the provided Python code into a mathematical problem statement and solution. Here's a breakdown of the thinking process:

1. **Identify the Core Problem:** The code simulates a bonding curve mechanism with trading agents and then optimizes the parameters of the bonding curve to minimize price volatility. This is the central theme.

2. **Define the State Variables:** What are the key quantities that change over time?
    * Token supply ($S_t$)
    * Token price ($P_t$)
    * Agent capital ($C_{i,t}$ for agent $i$)
    * Agent token holdings ($T_{i,t}$ for agent $i$)

3. **Formalize the Bonding Curve:** The code defines several bonding curve functions. Translate these into mathematical expressions. Crucially, the price is a function of the supply and the curve parameters.

4. **Model Agent Behavior:**  Agents make buy/sell decisions based on price trends. This needs to be described mathematically, although some simplification is needed as the agent's "memory" aspect is complex. Focus on the decision logic (buy if price is trending up, sell if trending down, with a random element).

5. **Describe the Trading Process:**  How do trades affect the state variables?
    * **Buy:**  Decrease agent capital, increase agent tokens, increase token supply.
    * **Sell:** Increase agent capital, decrease agent tokens, decrease token supply.
    * Account for trading fees.

6. **Formulate the Optimization Problem:** The goal is to minimize price volatility. How is volatility measured? The code uses the standard deviation of the price history.

7. **Structure the Solution:**  Present the mathematical formulation clearly, followed by a high-level description of the computational solution (the Python code).

8. **Use Mathematical Notation:** Employ standard symbols and notation for clarity. Use subscripts for time ($t$) and agent index ($i$).

9. **Incorporate the Code's Parameters:**  While the problem statement is abstract, it should mention the key parameters from the code, such as the number of agents, simulation steps, and initial conditions.

10. **Address Different Bonding Curve Types:** The code implements several curve types. Include these in the problem formulation.

11. **Explain the Objective Function:**  Clearly state that the goal is to minimize price volatility and how it's calculated.

12. **Describe the Optimization Method:** Explain that the code uses a randomized search to find optimal parameters.

13. **Acknowledge Simplifications:** The agent behavior in the code is relatively complex. The mathematical formulation might need to simplify this for clarity.

14. **Use LaTeX:** Employ LaTeX for mathematical equations to ensure proper formatting on platforms like GitHub.

15. **Review and Refine:** Read through the problem statement and solution to ensure accuracy, clarity, and completeness. Make sure the notation is consistent and the explanation is understandable. For example, initially, I might forget to include the trading fee in the buy/sell calculations, and would need to go back and add it. Also, making sure the notation for parameters aligns with the code.

### Problem Statement

The goal is to simulate a dynamic market environment with agents trading a token governed by a bonding curve and to optimize the parameters of this bonding curve to minimize the volatility of the token price.

**Given:**

*   A set of $N$ agents, indexed by $i \in \{1, 2, ..., N\}$.
*   A discrete time simulation with $T$ steps, indexed by $t \in \{0, 1, ..., T\}$.
*   An initial token supply $S_0$.
*   An initial capital for each agent $C_{i,0}$.
*   An initial token price $P_0$.
*   A trading fee $\phi$.
*   A bonding curve function $P(S, \theta)$, where $S$ is the token supply and $\theta$ represents the parameters of the bonding curve.
*   Agent trading behavior defined by parameters such as trade frequency, size range, memory size, trend threshold, and trend delay.

**Objective:**

Find the optimal bonding curve parameters $\theta^*$ that minimize the volatility of the token price over the simulation period. Volatility is measured by the standard deviation of the price history.

### Mathematical Model

**1. Bonding Curve:**

The token price $P_t$ at time $t$ is determined by the bonding curve function and the current token supply $S_t$:

$$P_t = P(S_t, \theta)$$

The specific forms of the bonding curve function considered are:

*   **Linear:** $P(S, \theta) = m S + b$, where $\theta = \{m, b\}$.
*   **Exponential:** $P(S, \theta) = a e^{k S}$, where $\theta = \{a, k\}$.
*   **Sigmoid:** $P(S, \theta) = \frac{k_{max}}{1 + e^{-k(S - s_0)}}$, where $\theta = \{k, s_0, k_{max}\}$.
*   **Multi-segment:**
    $$
    P(S, \theta) =
    \begin{cases}
      m S, & \text{if } S \le \text{breakpoint} \\
      m \cdot \text{breakpoint} + a e^{k (S - \text{breakpoint})}, & \text{if } S > \text{breakpoint}
    \end{cases}
    $$
    where $\theta = \{\text{breakpoint}, m, a, k\}$.

**2. Agent State:**

Each agent $i$ at time $t$ has:

*   Capital: $C_{i,t}$
*   Token holdings: $T_{i,t}$
*   Price memory: $M_{i,t} = [P_{t-M+1}, ..., P_t]$, where $M$ is the memory size.
*   Last trade step: $L_{i,t}$

**3. Agent Trading Decision:**

At each time step $t$, agent $i$ decides whether to buy or sell tokens based on:

*   A random trading frequency.
*   Analysis of the price trend using their memory $M_{i,t}$. The average price in the memory (excluding the latest price) is $\bar{P}_{i,t} = \frac{1}{M-1} \sum_{j=1}^{M-1} M_{i,t}[j]$. The price difference is $\Delta P_{i,t} = \frac{P_t - \bar{P}_{i,t}}{\bar{P}_{i,t}}$.
*   Trend threshold $\tau$:
    *   If $\Delta P_{i,t} > \tau$, the agent considers buying.
    *   If $\Delta P_{i,t} < -\tau$, the agent considers selling.
*   Trend delay $\delta$: Agents only trade if $t > L_{i,t} + \delta$.

**4. Trading Mechanics:**

If agent $i$ decides to trade at time $t$:

*   **Buy:**
    *   Determines a trade size (number of tokens to buy) $\Delta T_{buy}$.
    *   Calculates the cost: $\text{Cost} = \Delta T_{buy} \cdot P_t \cdot (1 + \phi)$.
    *   If $C_{i,t-1} \ge \text{Cost}$:
        *   $C_{i,t} = C_{i,t-1} - \text{Cost}$
        *   $T_{i,t} = T_{i,t-1} + \Delta T_{buy}$
        *   $S_t = S_{t-1} + \Delta T_{buy}$
*   **Sell:**
    *   Determines a trade size (number of tokens to sell) $\Delta T_{sell}$.
    *   Calculates the revenue: $\text{Revenue} = \Delta T_{sell} \cdot P_t \cdot (1 - \phi)$.
    *   If $T_{i,t-1} \ge \Delta T_{sell}$:
        *   $C_{i,t} = C_{i,t-1} + \text{Revenue}$
        *   $T_{i,t} = T_{i,t-1} - \Delta T_{sell}$
        *   $S_t = S_{t-1} - \Delta T_{sell}$

**5. Simulation Dynamics:**

The simulation proceeds iteratively:

*   Initialize agent states, token supply, and set $t=0$.
*   For each time step $t = 1, ..., T$:
    *   Calculate the current token price $P_t$ using the bonding curve and the current supply $S_{t-1}$.
    *   For each agent $i$:
        *   Update price memory.
        *   Determine if the agent trades and the trade size.
        *   Update agent capital, token holdings, and token supply based on executed trades.

**6. Objective Function for Optimization:**

The objective is to minimize the price volatility, measured by the standard deviation of the price history over $R$ simulation runs for a given set of bonding curve parameters $\theta$:

$$J(\theta) = \frac{1}{R} \sum_{r=1}^{R} \sqrt{\frac{1}{T-1} \sum_{t=1}^{T} (P_{r,t} - \bar{P}_r)^2}$$

where $P_{r,t}$ is the price at time $t$ in run $r$, and $\bar{P}_r = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} P_{r,t}$ is the average price in run $r$.

**7. Optimization Process:**

The Python code employs a randomized search approach to find the optimal parameters $\theta^*$:

*   Define a search space for the parameters of each bonding curve type.
*   Iteratively sample parameter sets $\theta$.
*   For each $\theta$, run $R$ simulations and calculate the objective function $J(\theta)$.
*   Keep track of the parameter set that yields the minimum $J(\theta)$.

### Solution Approach (Computational)

The provided Python code implements a discrete-time simulation of the described system. The `simulation_step` function calculates the state update at each time step based on agent trading decisions and the bonding curve mechanics. The `evaluate_parameters` function estimates the price volatility for a given set of bonding curve parameters by running multiple simulations. The `optimize_bonding_curve` function performs a randomized search over the parameter space to find the parameters that minimize the estimated price volatility.

The simulation involves:

*   Modeling individual agent behavior with probabilistic trading decisions based on price trends.
*   Updating the global state (token supply) based on aggregate trading activity.
*   Calculating the token price dynamically using the chosen bonding curve function.

The optimization uses a trial-and-error approach within predefined ranges for the bonding curve parameters, evaluating the price volatility for each trial and selecting the parameters that result in the lowest volatility.



# mcp

The user wants to translate the provided Python code into a mathematical problem statement and its solution in GitHub Markdown format, using LaTeX for equations. Here's a breakdown of the thought process:

1. **Identify the Core Components:** The code simulates an economy with agents and resources. The key elements to translate are:
    * **Agents:**  Their actions (requesting resources, adjusting needs, earning income, paying expenses, paying taxes), their state (balance, resource preferences, bankruptcy status).
    * **Resources:** Their attributes (capacity, load, price), their dynamics (price updates, allocation, deallocation, regeneration, capacity adjustment).
    * **Market Mechanism:** How agents interact with resources (requesting and allocating).
    * **Simulation Loop:** The steps involved in each time step.
    * **Metrics:**  The values tracked to evaluate the simulation (average balance, Gini coefficient, bankruptcies, average resource price).
    * **Parameter Experimentation:** How the code tests the impact of different parameters.

2. **Formulate the Problem Statement:**  The goal is to model a dynamic system. A good starting point is defining the state variables and how they evolve over time.

    * **State Variables:**  Clearly define the mathematical representation of the agents and resources at time *t*. This will involve notation like:
        * $B_i(t)$: Balance of agent *i* at time *t*.
        * $P_{ij}$: Resource preference of agent *i* for resource *j*.
        * $C_j(t)$: Capacity of resource *j* at time *t*.
        * $L_j(t)$: Load of resource *j* at time *t*.
        * $Pr_j(t)$: Price of resource *j* at time *t*.

    * **Objective:** State what the model aims to simulate – the dynamics of an economic system.

    * **Constraints and Parameters:**  List the key parameters and constraints that govern the system's behavior, such as the number of agents, resources, simulation steps, initial conditions, and the various rate constants.

3. **Derive the Equations (Solution):** This is the most crucial part. Translate the code's logic into mathematical equations. For each process:

    * **Agent Resource Request:** This is based on demand preference, price, and the agent's balance. Need to capture the clipping and conditionality.
    * **Resource Allocation:**  Limited by availability and agent's balance.
    * **Resource Price Update:** Directly related to the demand ratio.
    * **Resource Deallocation:** A fraction of the current load.
    * **Resource Regeneration:**  Dependent on the current capacity and average agent balance.
    * **Resource Capacity Adjustment:** Dependent on total economic output.
    * **Agent Income:** A base income plus a dynamic component related to resource prices, capped at a ceiling.
    * **Agent Expenses:** A rate applied to the agent's balance.
    * **Agent Taxes:** A percentage of the agent's balance.
    * **Wealth Redistribution:** Total taxes divided among non-bankrupt agents.
    * **Agent Bankruptcy:** Condition based on balance falling below a threshold.

4. **Define the Metrics:**  Express the evaluation metrics (average balance, Gini coefficient, bankruptcies, average resource price) mathematically. The Gini coefficient formula needs careful translation.

5. **Parameter Experimentation:** Explain how the code systematically varies parameters and evaluates the impact on the metrics.

6. **Structure in Markdown:** Organize the information using headings, subheadings, bullet points, and code blocks as appropriate for GitHub Markdown. Use `$` or `$$` to enclose LaTeX equations.

7. **Review and Refine:** Check for accuracy, clarity, and completeness. Ensure the mathematical notation is consistent and understandable. Make sure the equations accurately reflect the logic in the code. For instance, initially I might forget to include the clipping in the demand calculation or the conditionality based on the agent's balance in resource requests. Double-checking against the code is essential. Also, ensure proper formatting for Markdown.

**Self-Correction Example During the Process:**

Initially, I might write the resource request as a simple multiplication of preference and a price factor. However, looking back at the code, I see the `np.clip` function and the condition on the agent's balance. I need to adjust the equation to reflect these constraints more accurately. Similarly, the income calculation has a `min` function, which needs to be represented correctly in the mathematical formulation. The Gini coefficient formula needs careful transcription from the code to LaTeX.

By following these steps and carefully translating the Python code's logic, we can arrive at a comprehensive mathematical problem statement and solution. and Solution: Agent-Based Resource Economy Simulation

This document presents a mathematical formulation of the agent-based resource economy simulation described in the provided Python code.

### Problem Statement

Consider a closed economic system with $N$ agents and $M$ resources evolving over discrete time steps $t$. Each agent $i \in \{1, ..., N\}$ has a context balance $B_i(t)$ and a resource demand preference vector $\mathbf{P}_i \in [0, 1]^M$, where $P_{ij}$ represents agent $i$'s preference for resource $j$. Each resource $j \in \{1, ..., M\}$ has a capacity $C_j(t)$, a current load $L_j(t)$, and a price $Pr_j(t)$.

The system evolves according to the following rules at each time step $t$:

1. **Agent Resource Requests:** Each agent $i$ determines the demand for each resource $j$ based on its preference, the current price, and resource availability. The demand $D_{ij}(t)$ for resource $j$ by agent $i$ is given by:
   $$D_{ij}(t) = P_{ij} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{Pr_j(t)}{5 \cdot B}\right) \cdot \alpha_i(t)$$
   where $B$ is the base resource cost, and $\alpha_i(t)$ is a demand multiplier for agent $i$ at time $t$. The actual request is capped by resource availability and the agent's balance:
   $$R_{ij}(t) = \begin{cases}
       \min\left(D_{ij}(t), C_j(t) - L_j(t)\right) & \text{if } B_i(t) \ge Pr_j(t) \cdot D_{ij}(t) \text{ and } B_i(t) > B_{min} \\
       0 & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}$$
   where $B_{min}$ is the minimum agent balance.

2. **Resource Allocation:** Resources are allocated based on the aggregated requests. The allocated amount $A_{ij}(t)$ to agent $i$ for resource $j$ is considered up to the requested amount, prioritizing agents randomly to resolve conflicts if total requests exceed availability. The load of resource $j$ is updated:
   $$L_j(t+1) = L_j(t) + \sum_{i=1}^{N} A_{ij}(t)$$

3. **Resource Price Update:** The price of each resource $j$ is updated based on the demand ratio:
   $$Pr_j(t+1) = B \cdot \left(1 + \frac{L_j(t+1)}{C_j(t)} \cdot \epsilon\right)$$
   where $\epsilon$ is the price elasticity.

4. **Agent Balance Update (Transactions):**  When agent $i$ receives $A_{ij}(t)$ units of resource $j$, their balance is reduced by the cost:
   $$B_i(t+1) = B_i(t) - \sum_{j=1}^{M} A_{ij}(t) \cdot Pr_j(t)$$

5. **Resource Deallocation:** A fraction of the currently loaded resources is deallocated:
   $$L_j(t+1) = L_j(t+1) \cdot (1 - \delta)$$
   where $\delta$ is the deallocation rate.

6. **Resource Regeneration:** The capacity of each resource $j$ increases based on a regeneration rate and the average agent balance:
   $$C_j(t+1) = \min\left(C_{max}, C_j(t) \cdot (1 + \gamma + \mu \cdot \bar{B}(t))\right)$$
   where $\gamma$ is the base regeneration rate, $\mu$ is the dynamic regeneration multiplier, $C_{max}$ is the maximum resource capacity, and $\bar{B}(t)$ is the average agent balance at time $t$.

7. **Resource Capacity Adjustment:** The capacity of each resource $j$ also adjusts based on the total economic output:
    $$C_j(t+1) = \min\left(C_{max}, C_j(t+1) \cdot (1 + \eta \cdot E(t))\right)$$
    where $\eta$ is the resource capacity multiplier, and $E(t)$ is the total economic output at time $t$.

8. **Agent Need Adjustment:** Agent resource demand preferences are adjusted randomly:
   $$P_{ij}(t+1) = \text{clip}(P_{ij}(t) + \Delta_{ij}, 0, 1)$$
   where $\Delta_{ij}$ is a random value in $[-\theta, \theta]$.

9. **Agent Demand Multiplier Adjustment:** The demand multiplier for each agent increases over time:
   $$\alpha_i(t+1) = \min\left(1, \alpha_i(t) + \frac{0.9}{T}\right)$$
   where $T$ is the total number of simulation steps.

10. **Agent Income:** Each agent receives income:
    $$I_i(t) = \min\left(I_{base} + \zeta \cdot \bar{Pr}(t), I_{ceil}\right)$$
    where $I_{base}$ is the base agent income, $\zeta$ is the dynamic income multiplier, $\bar{Pr}(t)$ is the average resource price, and $I_{ceil}$ is the agent income ceiling.
    $$B_i(t+1) = B_i(t+1) + I_i(t)$$

11. **Agent Expenses:** Each agent incurs expenses:
    $$E_i^{exp}(t) = \xi \cdot (1 + \nu)$$
    where $\xi$ is the agent expense rate and $\nu$ is a random value in $[-0.2, 0.2]$.
    $$B_i(t+1) = B_i(t+1) - E_i^{exp}(t)$$

12. **Agent Taxes:** A tax is levied on each agent's balance:
    $$Tax_i(t) = \tau \cdot B_i(t+1)$$
    where $\tau$ is the tax rate.
    $$B_i(t+1) = B_i(t+1) - Tax_i(t)$$

13. **Wealth Redistribution:** The total collected taxes are redistributed equally among non-bankrupt agents.

14. **Bankruptcy:** An agent is declared bankrupt if their balance falls below a threshold $B_{bankrupt}$:
    $$\text{Bankrupt}_i(t) = \begin{cases}
        \text{True} & \text{if } B_i(t) \le B_{bankrupt} \\
        \text{False} & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}$$
    Bankrupt agents are removed from the simulation.

**Algorithm:**

1. **Initialization:** Initialize agent balances, resource capacities, loads, and prices according to the initial conditions.
2. **Simulation Loop (for $t = 0$ to $T-1$):**

### Evaluation Metrics

The simulation's outcome can be evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Average Final Balance:** $\bar{B}(T) = \frac{1}{N'} \sum_{i=1}^{N'} B_i(T)$, where $N'$ is the number of agents remaining at time $T$.
- **Gini Coefficient:** A measure of wealth inequality among agents, calculated as:
    $$G = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N'} \sum_{j=1}^{N'} |B_i(T) - B_j(T)|}{2 N'^2 \bar{B}(T)}$$
- **Number of Bankruptcies:** The total number of agents that went bankrupt during the simulation.
- **Average Final Resource Price:** $\bar{Pr}(T) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^{M} Pr_j(T)$.

### Parameter Experimentation

The Python code explores the impact of different parameter values on the simulation outcomes by systematically varying parameters like `price_elasticity`, `resource_regen_rate`, `tax_rate`, and `agent_expense_rate` and observing their effect on the evaluation metrics. This involves running multiple simulations with different parameter settings and plotting the resulting metrics.

This mathematical formulation provides a precise description of the agent-based resource economy simulation, allowing for further analytical study and potential mathematical proofs regarding the system's behavior.
