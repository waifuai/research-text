{"title": "Mathematical Framework for the Tokenized Economy", "link": "./18-tokenized-math.md", "description": "This paper introduces the Tokenized Economy's mathematical model built on Solana blockchain. 🔗 The core focuses on bonding curves that dynamically price tokens based on supply and demand. 📈 Linear and advanced bonding curves like sigmoid and polynomial are detailed with equations for buy/sell mechanics. 🧮 Token utility drives demand, and interconnected ICOs allow cross-influence in the ecosystem. 💼 Equilibrium, stability, and simulations explore the system's potential for democratization of capital. 🌍 Further research into optimal design and game theory is suggested for robust implementation. 🔬"}
