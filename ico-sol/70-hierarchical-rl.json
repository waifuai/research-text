  "description": "Introducing the Adaptive Hierarchical Intelligence (AHI) framework for Phase II, redefining autonomous agents in tokenized economies 🧠. Core innovations include elastic decision hierarchies that adapt dynamically based on complexity and feedback 📊. Skill fusion engine merges abilities into hybrid tactics using transformer embeddings for novel strategies 🤖. Swarm alignment protocol harmonizes agents via shared intent surfaces for cooperative decision-making 🌐. Horizon-aware optimization prioritizes long-term value through predictive models and composite rewards 📈. Leveraging Solana for blockchain efficiency and metrics for strategy diversity and throughput ⚡. Deploying in Q3 2025 with 100 agents scaling to 10,000, fostering self-regulating economic growth 🚀."
