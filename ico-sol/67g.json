  "link": "./67g.md",
  "description": "This paper formalizes equations capturing the recursive self-improvement of AI-driven RWA valuation models through technocapital acceleration 🤖📈. It models feedback loops in capital accumulation, market dynamics, and volatility, leading to potential singularity risks 🚀⚠️. Safeguards are integrated to dampen unchecked growth, ensuring human control over exponential valuation improvements 🛡️🔄. Ethical implications highlight the balance between innovation and systemic stability for sustainable AI-human interactions 💡🌐."
