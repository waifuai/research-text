Okay, I understand. You want a more comprehensive and "full" version of the Python simulation, building upon the previous example. This version will include:

*   **More Realistic Market Dynamics:**
    *   **Stochastic Price Fluctuations:** Introduce randomness to the price movements to simulate market volatility.
    *   **Dynamic Bonding Curve:** Allow the bonding curve parameters (base price and slope) to change over time, perhaps influenced by external factors or simulated news events.
    *   **Order Book (Partial):** Implement a simplified order book to simulate limited liquidity and price slippage.

*   **Enhanced Agent Capabilities:**
    *   **Variable Order Sizes:** Allow the agent to buy or sell varying amounts of tokens, not just the fixed `BASE_AMOUNT`.
    *   **More Granular State:**  Provide the agent with a more detailed view of the market state.
    *   **Transaction History:** Give the agent access to a short-term memory of recent transactions.
    *   **Inventory Penalty/Reward**: Implement penalties or rewards based on the agent's inventory level.

*   **Advanced Analysis and Visualization:**
    *   More detailed plots to track the agent's performance, market behavior, and Q-table evolution.
    *   Calculate and display key performance indicators (KPIs) like Sharpe ratio or maximum drawdown.

Here's the code for this more advanced simulation:

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

**Market Environment:**

*   **`generate_initial_order_book()`:** Creates a basic order book around the initial price with some random bids and asks.
*   **`add_dynamic_event()`:** Allows you to schedule changes to the bonding curve parameters (base price and slope) at specific simulation steps. This can simulate external events impacting the market.
*   **`apply_dynamic_events()`:** Applies the scheduled events and also introduces a probability of random dynamic events occurring at each step.
*   **`get_price()`:**
    *   Now includes random price fluctuations around the bonding curve price.
    *   Keeps track of a price history for trend calculations.
*   **`get_state()`:**
    *   Calculates the trend using a moving average of recent prices for a more robust trend signal.
    *   Includes the best bid and ask prices from the order book.
    *   Adds a short history of recent transactions (timestamp, price, amount, type).
*   **`buy()` and `sell()`:**
    *   These methods now interact with the `order_book`.
    *   The agent buys or sells by consuming orders from the book, starting with the best price.
    *   If an order is partially filled, the order book is updated accordingly.
    *   If the order book is depleted for a given side (bids or asks), it's regenerated.
    *   The `total_supply` is updated based on the actual amount of tokens bought or sold.
* **`update_time()`:** Added to keep track of the current simulation step in the `MarketEnvironment`.

**Agent:**

*   **`q_table`:** The Q-table now uses a tuple representation of the state `get_state_tuple()` and action `(action_type, amount)` to handle the more complex state and action spaces.
*   **`choose_action()`:**
    *   The agent can now choose to `buy`, `sell`, or `hold`.
    *   When buying or selling, it selects a random amount within a defined range (up to 50 in this case) or the maximum the agent can afford to buy or has in its inventory.
    *   The `valid_actions` are determined based on the agent's current balance and inventory.
    *   If exploiting, it iterates through possible actions (including different amounts for buy/sell) and selects the action with the highest Q-value for the current state.
*   **`get_state_tuple()`:** Converts the state dictionary into a tuple, making it hashable so it can be used as a key in the Q-table.
*   **`get_valid_actions()`:** Determines which actions are valid based on the agent's current balance and inventory.
*   **`update_q_table()`:**
    *   The Q-table update rule now considers the more complex state and action tuples.
    *   When a new state is encountered, possible actions for that state are initialized in the Q-table to ensure that all valid actions have a Q-value, even if they haven't been explored yet.
*   **`calculate_reward()`:**
    *   The reward function now includes a penalty/reward based on the agent's inventory level relative to predefined thresholds. This encourages the agent to maintain a reasonable inventory level.

**Simulation Loop:**

*   The loop now calls `environment.update_time()` and `environment.apply_dynamic_events()` to advance the simulation time and handle dynamic events.
*   It uses the `agent.get_valid_actions()` method to determine the valid actions for the agent in each step.
*   The agent's actions are now tuples `(action_type, amount)`.
*   The `buy()` and `sell()` methods of the environment are updated to return the actual amount of tokens bought or sold, which may be different from the requested amount due to order book limitations.
*   The reward is calculated based on the actual amount executed.
*   Results are stored in a more detailed format, including the `amount_requested`, `amount_executed`, `base_price`, and `slope`.

**Analysis and Visualization:**

*   **Plots:**
    *   **Balance and Inventory:** Tracks the agent's balance and inventory over time.
    *   **Market Price:** Visualizes the price fluctuations.
    *   **Actions:** Shows the agent's buy and sell actions (amount and time).
    *   **Rewards:** Displays the rewards received by the agent at each step.
    *   **Dynamic Bonding Curve:** Plots the changes in `base_price` and `slope` if dynamic events are used.
    *   **Q-table Heatmap:** Generates a heatmap to visualize a slice of the Q-table (for a specific action and amount). This helps to understand what the agent has learned.
*   **Performance Metrics:**
    *   **Total Return:** Calculates the overall return on investment.
    *   **Sharpe Ratio:** A measure of risk-adjusted return (simplified calculation here).
    *   **Maximum Drawdown:** The largest peak-to-trough decline during the simulation, indicating potential risk.

**How to Use and Experiment:**

1. **Copy and Run:** Copy the code into a Kaggle notebook or a local Python environment and run it.
2. **Observe:** Watch the simulation progress (balance, inventory, price, etc.) and examine the final plots and performance metrics.
3. **Experiment:**
    *   **Dynamic Events:** Modify the `environment.add_dynamic_event()` calls in the `__main__` block to create different scenarios with changing bonding curve parameters.
    *   **Parameters:** Adjust the simulation parameters (exploration rate, learning rate, discount factor, etc.) to see how they affect the agent's behavior and performance.
    *   **Order Book:** Change the `order_book_depth` and the logic in `generate_initial_order_book()` to create different order book structures.
    *   **Reward Function:** Experiment with different inventory penalty/reward thresholds and magnitudes in `calculate_reward()`.
    *   **State Representation:** Add more elements to the state returned by `get_state()`, such as volume, volatility indicators, or even external data.
    *   **Agent Logic:** Try different exploration strategies or more advanced RL algorithms (e.g., Deep Q-Networks).

**Further Development:**

*   **More Realistic Order Book:** Implement a more complete order book that allows for limit orders, market orders, and order cancellations.
*   **Transaction Costs:** Add transaction fees or slippage to make the simulation more realistic.
*   **Multiple Agents:** Introduce multiple agents to the simulation to create a more competitive environment.
*   **External Data:** Incorporate external data sources (e.g., price feeds from other exchanges, news sentiment) into the agent's state.
*   **Advanced RL Algorithms:** Implement more sophisticated reinforcement learning algorithms to improve the agent's performance.
*   **Backtesting Framework:** Develop a more robust backtesting framework that allows you to test your agent on historical data and evaluate its performance using a wider range of metrics.

This more comprehensive simulation provides a much richer environment for testing and developing your autonomous trading agent. Remember that this is still a simplification of the real world, but it's a significant step up from the initial version and should give you a much better idea of how your agent might perform on the actual Solana blockchain. Good luck!
