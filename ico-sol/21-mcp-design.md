Okay, let's design a Solana token, which we'll call "ContextCoin" (CTX), that integrates with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide access to resources while preventing spam and DDoS attacks through nominal SOL payments.

**1. Tokenomics of ContextCoin (CTX)**

*   **Name:** ContextCoin (CTX)
*   **Symbol:** CTX
*   **Total Supply:** Fixed at 1,000,000,000 CTX (1 Billion) - No minting after launch.
*   **Initial Distribution:**
    *   **Team & Development:** 20% (200,000,000 CTX) - Locked for 1 year, then vesting.
    *   **Ecosystem Fund:** 30% (300,000,000 CTX) - For grants, partnerships, and future developments within the MCP ecosystem.
    *   **Initial Sale:** 50% (500,000,000 CTX) - Sold via a bonding curve ICO.
*   **Decimal Places:** 9 - To support microtransactions and prevent integer overflow issues.
*   **Utility:**
    *   **Access to MCP Resources:** CTX is required to access resources provided by MCP servers (described later).
    *   **Staking/Voting:** Future option to stake CTX and participate in the governance of the MCP ecosystem.

**2. Bonding Curve ICO Details**

*   **Starting Price:** 0.00001 SOL per CTX.
*   **Bonding Curve:** Linear bonding curve, as defined in your prior whitepaper:
    *   P(T) = P₀ * (1 + T/S)
        *   P(T): Price of CTX after selling T tokens.
        *   P₀: Initial Price (0.00001 SOL).
        *   T: Total CTX tokens sold in the ICO.
        *   S: Scaling Factor (100,000,000). This means the price will double at 100 million tokens sold.
*   **ICO Duration:** No fixed duration, the ICO concludes after all 500,000,000 tokens are sold, or the bonding curve price goes too high.
*   **Incentives:** Early buyers will receive a lower average price per CTX token, and their purchasing power will increase as they are rewarded from holding onto their tokens and as the network grows.

**3. Integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP)**

*   **Resource Access:**
    *   MCP servers will implement a method to check for valid CTX balances.
    *   Users must have a sufficient CTX balance in their wallet to request resources.
    *   MCP client will facilitate this wallet checking as part of the request.
*   **Pay-Per-Access:**
    *   When a client sends a request to access a resource, it includes the transaction that transfers a small amount of CTX to the server (e.g., 0.0001 CTX). This payment is on a per-request basis.
    *   The transfer happens before the resource content is sent back, preventing abuse by users without sufficient tokens.
    *   The server uses a smart contract to verify payment and then grant access to the resource.
*   **Rate Limiting:**
    *   Servers can implement rate limiting per wallet address. This combined with per-request payments prevents users from spamming resources or causing a DDoS scenario.
    *   Users who spam too many requests will incur increasing costs as the prices increase along the bonding curve.
*   **Dynamic Pricing:**
    *   MCP servers can dynamically set their access fees based on demand. This allows them to manage resource availability and prevents overload.
    *   A server can also implement an access fee schedule to align with demand.

**4. Preventing Spam and DDoS Attacks**

*   **Cost Barrier:** By requiring a small payment per resource access request, spam and DDoS attacks become uneconomical. Attackers need to spend real money, making it a costly endeavor.
*   **Token Drain:** Spam accounts will have their CTX balance drained, preventing them from continuing attacks.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Combined with payment requirements, rate limiting prevents a single user from abusing the system, even if they have a substantial amount of CTX.
*   **Real Value:** Since access to resources requires CTX tokens, the network generates value and will encourage organic demand for the tokens.
*   **Transaction Fees:** Solana's low transaction fees ensure that small micro-payments are still practical.

**5. Smart Contract Implementation**

*   **Token Contract:** A standard SPL token contract for CTX.
*   **Verification Contract:** A smart contract will handle verification of payments, and resource authorization:
    *   `verify_payment(wallet_address, server_address, amount)` - Checks that a user paid an amount to a server before resource access.
    *   `authorize_access(wallet_address, server_address)` - Verifies that a user is authorized to access specific resources, usually based on a previous transaction.
    *   `set_resource_cost(server_address, resource_id, cost)` - Allows servers to dynamically adjust access fees for specific resources.
    *   This contract will also handle initial token distribution.
*   **Wallet-to-Wallet Transfers:** Solana's normal wallet transfer functionality would be used for payments within the system.
*   **Escrow Mechanism:** A built-in escrow mechanism to ensure that servers cannot cheat and withhold resources after receiving CTX.

**6. Key Considerations**

*   **User Experience:** Making the micro-payment process smooth is critical.  Wallets need to provide an easy way to authorize small token payments.
*   **Server Adoption:** Encouraging MCP server operators to implement CTX payments is crucial.
*   **Security:** Ensure the smart contracts and payment mechanisms are robust against attacks and bugs.

**7. Benefits**

*   **Scalable Access:** CTX enables scalable and affordable access to valuable resources within the MCP ecosystem.
*   **Spam/DDoS Prevention:** A powerful defense against attacks by requiring payments for each resource access.
*   **Decentralization:** All transactions are decentralized on the Solana blockchain.
*   **Incentive Alignment:** Motivates both server operators and resource users to participate in the network.
*   **Real-World Value:** The utility of the CTX token gives it real-world value and encourages a sustainable economy.

**8. Future Development**

*   **Staking and Governance:** Implement staking of CTX tokens and enable holders to vote on the direction of the MCP ecosystem.
*   **Tiered Access:** Servers can provide tiered access based on the amount of CTX the user holds.
*   **Integration with DeFi:** Allow the CTX token to be used in decentralized finance applications on Solana.

By combining the principles of a bonding curve ICO with a practical application within the Model Context Protocol, ContextCoin (CTX) presents a viable solution for enabling secure, scalable, and accessible resources while effectively preventing spam and DDoS attacks.
