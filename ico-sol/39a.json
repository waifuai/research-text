  "link": "./39a.md",
  "description": "🔍 This document presents a rigorous mathematical translation of a Python simulation modeling token economies where prices fluctuate via dynamic bonding curves 📊. 👥 Affiliates engage in buying/selling tokens, earning adjustable commissions that influence their behaviors over discrete time steps ⏳. ⚙️ The formulation includes equations for supply/demand dynamics, commission adjustments, and analysis of market stability 📉. 🌟 Researchers can leverage concrete examples of bonding curve functions like linear and exponential to probe decentralized systems 🏦."
