Below is a detailed development of the equations for the reinforcement learning (RL) framework applied to agent-based economic systems with dynamic asset pricing. These equations cover agent dynamics, asset pricing mechanisms, reward functions, and optimization processes.

### **1. Agent Dynamics**

#### **1.1. State Space ($S_i(t)$)**  
The state of agent $i$ at time $t$ includes its balance, asset holdings, and market observations:  
$$
S_i(t) = \left[ B_i(t), H_{i,1}(t), H_{i,2}(t), \dots, H_{i,M}(t), P_1(t), P_2(t), \dots, P_M(t), \mathbf{M}(t) \right]
$$  
where:  
- $B_i(t)$: Balance of agent $i$ at time $t$.  
- $H_{i,j}(t)$: Holdings of asset $j$ by agent $i$ at time $t$.  
- $P_j(t)$: Price of asset $j$ at time $t$.  
- $\mathbf{M}(t)$: Market conditions (e.g., total supply, demand, external shocks).

#### **1.2. Action Space ($A_i(t)$)**  
The action of agent $i$ at time $t$ includes buying, selling, or holding assets:  
$$
A_i(t) = \left[ a_{i,1}(t), a_{i,2}(t), \dots, a_{i,M}(t) \right]
$$  
where $a_{i,j}(t)$ represents the action for asset $j$:  
$$
a_{i,j}(t) \in \{-1, 0, 1\}
$$  
- $-1$: Sell one unit of asset $j$.  
- $0$: Hold asset $j$.  
- $1$: Buy one unit of asset $j$.

#### **1.3. Policy ($\pi_i$)**  
The policy $\pi_i$ maps states to actions:  
$$
\pi_i: S_i(t) \rightarrow A_i(t)
$$  
For example, using a softmax policy:  
$$
\pi_i(a_i(t) | S_i(t)) = \frac{e^{Q_i(S_i(t), a_i(t)) / \tau}}{\sum_{a'} e^{Q_i(S_i(t), a') / \tau}}
$$  
where $Q_i$ is the action-value function, and $\tau$ is the temperature parameter.

### **2. Asset Pricing Mechanisms**

#### **2.1. Bonding Curve**  
The price of asset $j$ is determined by a bonding curve $f_j$:  
$$
P_j(t) = f_j(S_j(t), \mathbf{\Phi}_j(t))
$$  
where:  
- $S_j(t)$: Total supply of asset $j$ at time $t$.  
- $\mathbf{\Phi}_j(t)$: Parameters of the bonding curve (e.g., slope, intercept).  

Examples of bonding curves:  
- **Linear:**  
  $$
  P_j(t) = m_j S_j(t) + b_j
  $$  
- **Exponential:**  
  $$
  P_j(t) = a_j e^{k_j S_j(t)}
  $$  
- **Sigmoid:**  
  $$
  P_j(t) = \frac{K_j}{1 + e^{-k_j(S_j(t) - S_{0,j})}}
  $$

#### **2.2. Market Clearing**  
Prices can also emerge from market clearing conditions:  
$$
D_j(P_j(t)) = O_j(P_j(t))
$$  
where $D_j$ and $O_j$ are the demand and supply functions for asset $j$.

### **3. Reward Function**

#### **3.1. Utility-Based Reward**  
The reward $r_i(t)$ for agent $i$ is based on its utility function $U_i$:  
$$
r_i(t) = U_i(B_i(t), H_{i,j}(t), P_j(t))
$$  
For example, a profit-maximizing agent might have:  
$$
U_i = \sum_{j=1}^M \left[ H_{i,j}(t) \cdot P_j(t) \right] + B_i(t)
$$

#### **3.2. Risk-Adjusted Reward**  
A risk-averse agent might include a penalty for volatility:  
$$
U_i = \sum_{j=1}^M \left[ H_{i,j}(t) \cdot P_j(t) \right] + B_i(t) - \lambda \cdot \text{Var}(P_j(t))
$$  
where $\lambda$ is the risk aversion coefficient.

### **4. System Dynamics**

#### **4.1. Asset Supply Update**  
The supply of asset $j$ changes based on minting, burning, or agent actions:  
$$
S_j(t+1) = S_j(t) + \sum_{i=1}^N a_{i,j}(t)
$$

#### **4.2. Agent Balance Update**  
The balance of agent $i$ is updated based on trading and policy interventions:  
$$
B_i(t+1) = B_i(t) - \sum_{j=1}^M a_{i,j}(t) \cdot P_j(t) + \text{Income}_i(t) + \text{PolicyEffects}_i(t)
$$

#### **4.3. Agent Holdings Update**  
The holdings of agent $i$ for asset $j$ are updated as:  
$$
H_{i,j}(t+1) = H_{i,j}(t) + a_{i,j}(t)
$$

### **5. Reinforcement Learning Algorithms**

#### **5.1. Q-Learning**  
The action-value function $Q_i$ is updated as:  
$$
Q_i(S_i(t), A_i(t)) \leftarrow Q_i(S_i(t), A_i(t)) + \alpha \left[ r_i(t) + \gamma \max_{a'} Q_i(S_i(t+1), a') - Q_i(S_i(t), A_i(t)) \right]
$$  
where:  
- $\alpha$: Learning rate.  
- $\gamma$: Discount factor.

#### **5.2. Policy Gradient**  
The policy parameters $\theta_i$ are updated using the gradient:  
$$
\theta_i \leftarrow \theta_i + \alpha \nabla_{\theta_i} \log \pi_i(A_i(t) | S_i(t)) \cdot G_i(t)
$$  
where $G_i(t)$ is the cumulative reward:  
$$
G_i(t) = \sum_{k=0}^T \gamma^k r_i(t+k)
$$

#### **5.3. Deep RL**  
For high-dimensional state spaces, a neural network approximates the Q-function or policy:  
$$
Q_i(S_i(t), A_i(t)) \approx Q_i(S_i(t), A_i(t); \mathbf{W}_i)
$$  
where $\mathbf{W}_i$ are the network weights.

### **6. Optimization**

#### **6.1. Bonding Curve Parameter Optimization**  
The parameters $\mathbf{\Phi}_j(t)$ are optimized to minimize price volatility:  
$$
\min_{\mathbf{\Phi}_j} \text{Var}(P_j(t))
$$

#### **6.2. Airdrop Strategy Optimization**  
The airdrop strategy is optimized to maximize adoption:  
$$
\max_{\mathbf{AirdropParams}} \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{I}(H_{i,j}(t) > 0)
$$  
where $\mathbb{I}$ is the indicator function.

### **7. Metrics for Evaluation**

#### **7.1. Price Volatility**  
$$
\text{Volatility}(P_j) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T (P_j(t) - \bar{P}_j)^2}
$$

#### **7.2. Wealth Distribution (Gini Coefficient)**  
$$
G = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^N |B_i(t) - B_k(t)|}{2N \sum_{i=1}^N B_i(t)}
$$

#### **7.3. Resource Utilization**  
$$
\text{Utilization} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N Q_{i,j}(t)}{C_j}
$$  
where $C_j$ is the total capacity of resource $j$.
