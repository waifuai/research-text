# bonding curve

The user wants to translate the provided Python code into a mathematical problem statement and solution. Here's a breakdown of the thinking process:

1. **Identify the Core Problem:** The code simulates a bonding curve mechanism with trading agents and then optimizes the parameters of the bonding curve to minimize price volatility. This is the central theme.

2. **Define the State Variables:** What are the key quantities that change over time?
    * Token supply ($S_t$)
    * Token price ($P_t$)
    * Agent capital ($C_{i,t}$ for agent $i$)
    * Agent token holdings ($T_{i,t}$ for agent $i$)

3. **Formalize the Bonding Curve:** The code defines several bonding curve functions. Translate these into mathematical expressions. Crucially, the price is a function of the supply and the curve parameters.

4. **Model Agent Behavior:**  Agents make buy/sell decisions based on price trends. This needs to be described mathematically, although some simplification is needed as the agent's "memory" aspect is complex. Focus on the decision logic (buy if price is trending up, sell if trending down, with a random element).

5. **Describe the Trading Process:**  How do trades affect the state variables?
    * **Buy:**  Decrease agent capital, increase agent tokens, increase token supply.
    * **Sell:** Increase agent capital, decrease agent tokens, decrease token supply.
    * Account for trading fees.

6. **Formulate the Optimization Problem:** The goal is to minimize price volatility. How is volatility measured? The code uses the standard deviation of the price history.

7. **Structure the Solution:**  Present the mathematical formulation clearly, followed by a high-level description of the computational solution (the Python code).

8. **Use Mathematical Notation:** Employ standard symbols and notation for clarity. Use subscripts for time ($t$) and agent index ($i$).

9. **Incorporate the Code's Parameters:**  While the problem statement is abstract, it should mention the key parameters from the code, such as the number of agents, simulation steps, and initial conditions.

10. **Address Different Bonding Curve Types:** The code implements several curve types. Include these in the problem formulation.

11. **Explain the Objective Function:**  Clearly state that the goal is to minimize price volatility and how it's calculated.

12. **Describe the Optimization Method:** Explain that the code uses a randomized search to find optimal parameters.

13. **Acknowledge Simplifications:** The agent behavior in the code is relatively complex. The mathematical formulation might need to simplify this for clarity.

14. **Use LaTeX:** Employ LaTeX for mathematical equations to ensure proper formatting on platforms like GitHub.

15. **Review and Refine:** Read through the problem statement and solution to ensure accuracy, clarity, and completeness. Make sure the notation is consistent and the explanation is understandable. For example, initially, I might forget to include the trading fee in the buy/sell calculations, and would need to go back and add it. Also, making sure the notation for parameters aligns with the code.

### Problem Statement

The goal is to simulate a dynamic market environment with agents trading a token governed by a bonding curve and to optimize the parameters of this bonding curve to minimize the volatility of the token price.

**Given:**

*   A set of $N$ agents, indexed by $i \in \{1, 2, ..., N\}$.
*   A discrete time simulation with $T$ steps, indexed by $t \in \{0, 1, ..., T\}$.
*   An initial token supply $S_0$.
*   An initial capital for each agent $C_{i,0}$.
*   An initial token price $P_0$.
*   A trading fee $\phi$.
*   A bonding curve function $P(S, \theta)$, where $S$ is the token supply and $\theta$ represents the parameters of the bonding curve.
*   Agent trading behavior defined by parameters such as trade frequency, size range, memory size, trend threshold, and trend delay.

**Objective:**

Find the optimal bonding curve parameters $\theta^*$ that minimize the volatility of the token price over the simulation period. Volatility is measured by the standard deviation of the price history.

### Mathematical Model

**1. Bonding Curve:**

The token price $P_t$ at time $t$ is determined by the bonding curve function and the current token supply $S_t$:

$$P_t = P(S_t, \theta)$$

The specific forms of the bonding curve function considered are:

*   **Linear:** $P(S, \theta) = m S + b$, where $\theta = \{m, b\}$.
*   **Exponential:** $P(S, \theta) = a e^{k S}$, where $\theta = \{a, k\}$.
*   **Sigmoid:** $P(S, \theta) = \frac{k_{max}}{1 + e^{-k(S - s_0)}}$, where $\theta = \{k, s_0, k_{max}\}$.
*   **Multi-segment:**
    $$
    P(S, \theta) =
    \begin{cases}
      m S, & \text{if } S \le \text{breakpoint} \\
      m \cdot \text{breakpoint} + a e^{k (S - \text{breakpoint})}, & \text{if } S > \text{breakpoint}
    \end{cases}
    $$
    where $\theta = \{\text{breakpoint}, m, a, k\}$.

**2. Agent State:**

Each agent $i$ at time $t$ has:

*   Capital: $C_{i,t}$
*   Token holdings: $T_{i,t}$
*   Price memory: $M_{i,t} = [P_{t-M+1}, ..., P_t]$, where $M$ is the memory size.
*   Last trade step: $L_{i,t}$

**3. Agent Trading Decision:**

At each time step $t$, agent $i$ decides whether to buy or sell tokens based on:

*   A random trading frequency.
*   Analysis of the price trend using their memory $M_{i,t}$. The average price in the memory (excluding the latest price) is $\bar{P}_{i,t} = \frac{1}{M-1} \sum_{j=1}^{M-1} M_{i,t}[j]$. The price difference is $\Delta P_{i,t} = \frac{P_t - \bar{P}_{i,t}}{\bar{P}_{i,t}}$.
*   Trend threshold $\tau$:
    *   If $\Delta P_{i,t} > \tau$, the agent considers buying.
    *   If $\Delta P_{i,t} < -\tau$, the agent considers selling.
*   Trend delay $\delta$: Agents only trade if $t > L_{i,t} + \delta$.

**4. Trading Mechanics:**

If agent $i$ decides to trade at time $t$:

*   **Buy:**
    *   Determines a trade size (number of tokens to buy) $\Delta T_{buy}$.
    *   Calculates the cost: $\text{Cost} = \Delta T_{buy} \cdot P_t \cdot (1 + \phi)$.
    *   If $C_{i,t-1} \ge \text{Cost}$:
        *   $C_{i,t} = C_{i,t-1} - \text{Cost}$
        *   $T_{i,t} = T_{i,t-1} + \Delta T_{buy}$
        *   $S_t = S_{t-1} + \Delta T_{buy}$
*   **Sell:**
    *   Determines a trade size (number of tokens to sell) $\Delta T_{sell}$.
    *   Calculates the revenue: $\text{Revenue} = \Delta T_{sell} \cdot P_t \cdot (1 - \phi)$.
    *   If $T_{i,t-1} \ge \Delta T_{sell}$:
        *   $C_{i,t} = C_{i,t-1} + \text{Revenue}$
        *   $T_{i,t} = T_{i,t-1} - \Delta T_{sell}$
        *   $S_t = S_{t-1} - \Delta T_{sell}$

**5. Simulation Dynamics:**

The simulation proceeds iteratively:

*   Initialize agent states, token supply, and set $t=0$.
*   For each time step $t = 1, ..., T$:
    *   Calculate the current token price $P_t$ using the bonding curve and the current supply $S_{t-1}$.
    *   For each agent $i$:
        *   Update price memory.
        *   Determine if the agent trades and the trade size.
        *   Update agent capital, token holdings, and token supply based on executed trades.

**6. Objective Function for Optimization:**

The objective is to minimize the price volatility, measured by the standard deviation of the price history over $R$ simulation runs for a given set of bonding curve parameters $\theta$:

$$J(\theta) = \frac{1}{R} \sum_{r=1}^{R} \sqrt{\frac{1}{T-1} \sum_{t=1}^{T} (P_{r,t} - \bar{P}_r)^2}$$

where $P_{r,t}$ is the price at time $t$ in run $r$, and $\bar{P}_r = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} P_{r,t}$ is the average price in run $r$.

**7. Optimization Process:**

The Python code employs a randomized search approach to find the optimal parameters $\theta^*$:

*   Define a search space for the parameters of each bonding curve type.
*   Iteratively sample parameter sets $\theta$.
*   For each $\theta$, run $R$ simulations and calculate the objective function $J(\theta)$.
*   Keep track of the parameter set that yields the minimum $J(\theta)$.

### Solution Approach (Computational)

The provided Python code implements a discrete-time simulation of the described system. The `simulation_step` function calculates the state update at each time step based on agent trading decisions and the bonding curve mechanics. The `evaluate_parameters` function estimates the price volatility for a given set of bonding curve parameters by running multiple simulations. The `optimize_bonding_curve` function performs a randomized search over the parameter space to find the parameters that minimize the estimated price volatility.

The simulation involves:

*   Modeling individual agent behavior with probabilistic trading decisions based on price trends.
*   Updating the global state (token supply) based on aggregate trading activity.
*   Calculating the token price dynamically using the chosen bonding curve function.

The optimization uses a trial-and-error approach within predefined ranges for the bonding curve parameters, evaluating the price volatility for each trial and selecting the parameters that result in the lowest volatility.
