# 2: stochastic examples

Below, I expand on the use of stochastic models in the context of tokenized ecosystems, building on the foundation laid in the previous continuation paper. This exploration introduces randomness and probabilistic behavior into the AbundanceCoin ICO, Tokenized Economy, and TokenAffiliates frameworks, emphasizing stochastic differential equations (SDEs), Markov processes, and Monte Carlo simulations. Each section is self-contained, adhering to the guidelines from your thinking process, redefining all variables and contexts within the problem statements, and incorporating a substantial number of equations as requested.
Stochastic Models in Tokenized Ecosystems
Tokenized ecosystems, such as those involving Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), multi-token economies, and affiliate programs, operate in dynamic environments where prices, supplies, and participant behaviors fluctuate unpredictably. Stochastic models provide a mathematical framework to capture this uncertainty, enabling predictions of expected behavior and risk assessment. This paper introduces stochastic extensions to the AbundanceCoin ICO, Tokenized Economy dynamics, and TokenAffiliates commission structures, leveraging stochastic differential equations, Markov chains, and simulation techniques.
8. Stochastic Price Dynamics in AbundanceCoin ICO
Problem Statement:
Consider the AbundanceCoin token launched through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), where the price is influenced not only by supply but also by random market forces. Define the price of AbundanceCoin at circulating supply 
S(t)
 and time 
t
 as 
P(t)
, governed by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that extends the linear bonding curve. The price dynamics are modeled as:
$$dP(t) = \mu (m S(t) + b - P(t)) \, dt + \sigma P(t) \, dW(t)$$
where:
$P(t)$
 is the price of AbundanceCoin at time
$t$
.
$S(t)$
 is the circulating supply at time
$t$
, assumed to evolve deterministically as
$$S(t) = S_0 + \kappa t$$
(linear supply growth with rate
$\kappa$
).
$m$
  is the slope of the bonding curve, and
 $b$
  is the base price.
 $\mu$
  is the mean reversion rate, pulling the price toward the bonding curve
 $m S(t) + b$
 .
 $\sigma$
  is the volatility coefficient, scaling random fluctuations.
 $W(t)$
  is a Wiener process, with
$$dW(t) \sim N(0, dt)$$
 , representing market noise.
Determine:
a) The expected price
 $\mathbb{E}[P(t)]$
  at time
 $t$
 , assuming an initial price
 $P(0) = P_0$
 .
 b) The variance of the price
 $\text{Var}[P(t)]$
  to assess price uncertainty.
Solution:
This is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process modified with a time-dependent drift term. Define the equilibrium price as
$$P_{\text{eq}}(t) = m S(t) + b = m (S_0 + \kappa t) + b$$
 .
a) Expected Price:
  For the SDE
$$dP(t) = \mu (P_{\text{eq}}(t) - P(t)) \, dt + \sigma P(t) \, dW(t)$$
 , the stochastic term
 $\sigma P(t) dW(t)$
 has zero expectation. However, the multiplicative noise complicates the solution. Applying ItÃ´'s lemma to 
X(t) = P(t) e^{\mu t}
, we derive:
 
$$dX(t) = e^{\mu t} dP(t) + \mu e^{\mu t} P(t) \, dt$$
 
 Substitute 
dP(t)
:
 
$$dX(t) = e^{\mu t} [ \mu (P_{\text{eq}}(t) - P(t)) \, dt + \sigma P(t) \, dW(t) ] + \mu e^{\mu t} P(t) \, dt$$
 
$$= \mu e^{\mu t} P_{\text{eq}}(t) \, dt + \sigma e^{\mu t} P(t) \, dW(t)$$
 
 Integrate from 0 to 
t
:
 
$$X(t) = X(0) + \int_0^t \mu e^{\mu s} P_{\text{eq}}(s) \, ds + \int_0^t \sigma e^{\mu s} P(s) \, dW(s)$$
 
 Since 
$$X(t) = P(t) e^{\mu t}$$
 and 
X(0) = P_0
, take expectations (
\mathbb{E}[\text{stochastic integral}] = 0
):
 
$$\mathbb{E}[P(t)] e^{\mu t} = P_0 + \int_0^t \mu e^{\mu s} [m (S_0 + \kappa s) + b] \, ds$$
 
 Compute the integral:
 
$$\int_0^t \mu e^{\mu s} (m S_0 + m \kappa s + b) \, ds = \mu m S_0 \int_0^t e^{\mu s} \, ds + \mu m \kappa \int_0^t s e^{\mu s} \, ds + \mu b \int_0^t e^{\mu s} \, ds$$
$$\int_0^t e^{\mu s} \, ds = \frac{1}{\mu} (e^{\mu t} - 1)$$
$$\int_0^t s e^{\mu s} \, ds = \left[ \frac{s e^{\mu s}}{\mu} \right]_0^t - \int_0^t \frac{e^{\mu s}}{\mu} \, ds = \frac{t e^{\mu t}}{\mu} - \frac{1}{\mu^2} (e^{\mu t} - 1)$$
 
 Thus:
 
$$\mathbb{E}[P(t)] = e^{-\mu t} P_0 + m S_0 (1 - e^{-\mu t}) + m \kappa \left( t - \frac{1 - e^{-\mu t}}{\mu} \right) + b (1 - e^{-\mu t})$$
b) Variance:
 The variance computation is complex due to multiplicative noise. For simplicity, consider a geometric Brownian motion approximation (
$$dP = \mu P \, dt + \sigma P \, dW$$
), where:
 
$$P(t) = P_0 e^{(\mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}) t + \sigma W(t)}$$

$$\text{Var}[P(t)] = P_0^2 e^{2 \mu t} (e^{\sigma^2 t} - 1)$$
 
 For the original SDE, numerical methods (e.g., Monte Carlo) are typically required.
9. Markov Chain Model for Token Exchange in a Tokenized Economy
Problem Statement:
In a tokenized economy with two tokens, Token A and Token B, traders exchange tokens based on their relative prices, which follow bonding curves:
Price of Token A: 
P_A(S_A) = m_A S_A + b_A
, where 
S_A
 is the supply.
Price of Token B: 
P_B(S_B) = m_B S_B + b_B
, with 
S_B
 as its supply.
Model trader behavior as a discrete-time Markov chain with three states:
State 1: Hold Token A.
State 2: Hold Token B.
State 3: Hold neither (cash position).
Transition probabilities depend on the exchange rate 
R = \frac{P_A(S_A)}{P_B(S_B)}
 and a threshold 
\theta
:
P_{1 \to 2} = \min(1, R / \theta)
 (swap A for B if A is relatively expensive).
P_{2 \to 1} = \min(1, \theta / R)
 (swap B for A if B is expensive).
P_{i \to 3} = 0.1
 (fixed probability of cashing out).
P_{i \to i} = 1 - \sum_{j \neq i} P_{i \to j}
.
Determine:
a) The transition matrix 
\mathbf{P}
 for given supplies 
S_A
 and 
S_B
.
b) The steady-state distribution 
\pi
 of traders across states.
Solution:
a) Transition Matrix:
 Let 
R = \frac{m_A S_A + b_A}{m_B S_B + b_B}
. The matrix is:
 
\mathbf{P} = \begin{bmatrix}
 1 - P_{1 \to 2} - 0.1 & P_{1 \to 2} & 0.1 \\
 P_{2 \to 1} & 1 - P_{2 \to 1} - 0.1 & 0.1 \\
 0.2 & 0.2 & 0.6
\end{bmatrix}
P_{1 \to 2} = \min(1, R / \theta)
P_{2 \to 1} = \min(1, \theta / R)
Row sums equal 1.
b) Steady-State Distribution:
 Solve 
\pi \mathbf{P} = \pi
 with 
\pi_1 + \pi_2 + \pi_3 = 1
. Set up equations:
 
\pi_1 (1 - P_{1 \to 2} - 0.1) + \pi_2 P_{2 \to 1} + 0.2 \pi_3 = \pi_1
 
 \pi_1 P_{1 \to 2} + \pi_2 (1 - P_{2 \to 1} - 0.1) + 0.2 \pi_3 = \pi_2
 
 Simplify and solve numerically for specific 
R
 and 
\theta
.
10. Monte Carlo Simulation for TokenAffiliates Earnings
Problem Statement:
In the TokenAffiliates program, affiliates earn commissions on investments in AbundanceCoin, where the price follows a stochastic bonding curve:
P(S) = m S + b + \sigma W(t)
S
 is the supply, 
m
 and 
b
 are the slope and base price, 
\sigma
 is volatility, and 
W(t)
 is a Wiener process.
Commission rate is 
\alpha
, and investment amounts 
I
 are random, following a lognormal distribution: 
I \sim \text{Lognormal}(\mu_I, \sigma_I^2)
.
Determine:
a) The expected total earnings 
E
 over 
n
 investments using a Monte Carlo simulation framework.
b) The probability that total earnings exceed a threshold 
K
.
Solution:
a) Expected Earnings:
 For each investment 
i
:
Sample 
S_i
 (e.g., 
S_i = S_0 + i \cdot \Delta S
).
Sample 
W(t_i) \sim N(0, t_i)
 for time 
t_i = i \cdot \Delta t
.
Compute 
P_i = m S_i + b + \sigma W(t_i)
.
Sample 
I_i \sim \text{Lognormal}(\mu_I, \sigma_I^2)
.
Commission: 
C_i = \alpha I_i P_i
.
 Total earnings for one simulation: 
E^{(k)} = \sum_{i=1}^n C_i
.
 Average over 
M
 simulations:
 
\mathbb{E}[E] \approx \frac{1}{M} \sum_{k=1}^M E^{(k)}
b) Probability 
P(E > K)
:
 Count simulations where 
E^{(k)} > K
:
 
P(E > K) \approx \frac{1}{M} \sum_{k=1}^M \mathbb{I}(E^{(k)} > K)
 
 where 
\mathbb{I}
 is the indicator function.
These stochastic models introduce randomness via SDEs for price dynamics, Markov chains for behavioral transitions, and Monte Carlo methods for earnings estimation, providing robust tools to analyze tokenized systems under uncertainty.
