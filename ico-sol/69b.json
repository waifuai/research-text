  "link": "./69b.md",
  "description": "This derivation presents a custom SDE tailored for Project Genesis, modeling token price evolution with bonding curves and stochastic fluctuations. 🧮 The approach combines deterministic supply-driven drift with random market noise using Brownian motion. 📉 It incorporates mean-reversion mechanics for agent behavior, ensuring prices align with economic incentives. 🎲 Practical simulation code is included for easy implementation in Python. 🖥️ Extensions like stochastic volatility and jump processes are proposed for further enhancement. 🚀"
