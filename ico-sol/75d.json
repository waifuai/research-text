  "description": "ðŸš€ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) extends Bayesian inference to tokenized ecosystems with complex posteriors. ðŸ”¬ The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm enables sampling from distributions hard to compute analytically. ðŸ“ˆ This method refines bonding curve slopes and base prices in AbundanceCoin ICO using noisy price data. ðŸ’° MCMC estimates exchange rate parameters between Token A and Token B in tokenized economies. ðŸŽ¯ It optimizes commission rates dynamically in TokenAffiliates programs through expected commission maximization. ðŸ“Š Detailed equations define likelihoods, priors, and acceptance probabilities for each application. âœ… Parameter estimation discards burn-in samples for accuracy in decentralized finance models. ðŸŒŸ Tuning proposal covariance matrices ensures convergence and reliable results. ðŸ§  MCMC provides powerful computational tools for high-dimensional crypto system analysis."
