Here's a thinking process to make each problem statement self-contained:

1. **Identify Dependencies:**  For each problem statement, review if it relies on definitions or variables introduced in previous problem statements. For example, the "Tokenized Economy" problem references the bonding curve concept from the "AbundanceCoin ICO" problem.

2. **Re-introduce Necessary Information:**  If a problem statement depends on prior concepts, explicitly redefine those concepts within the current problem statement. This means copying relevant definitions or equations. Don't just refer back; make it a standalone explanation.

3. **Define All Variables:** Ensure every variable used in a problem statement's equations or descriptions is defined *within that specific problem statement*. Avoid using pronouns or implied references to variables defined earlier.

4. **Clarify Context:** Provide a brief context for each problem. What scenario or system is being analyzed? This helps in understanding the purpose of the mathematical formulation.

5. **Maintain Consistency in Notation:** If a variable has the same meaning across multiple problem statements, use the same notation consistently. This aids understanding and reduces confusion.

6. **Structure for Clarity:** Use headings, bullet points, and clear language to organize the problem statement. Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts.

7. **Review and Refine:** After making the changes, reread each problem statement independently. Could someone understand the problem and its solution without having read the previous sections?  Are all the necessary terms and symbols defined?

**Example of Self-Correction during the process:**

* **Initial thought (for Tokenized Economy):** "Given the bonding curve as defined in Problem 1..."
* **Correction:** Realized this isn't self-contained. Need to explicitly state the bonding curve equation within the Tokenized Economy problem.
* **Revised thought:** "Consider a simplified Tokenized Economy with two tokens, A and B, with bonding curves defined by: $P_A(S_A) = m_A S_A + b_A$ and $P_B(S_B) = m_B S_B + b_B$."

* **Initial thought (for TokenAffiliates):** "Calculate the commission..." (assuming the basic model is understood).
* **Correction:** Need to explicitly define the basic model within the problem statement before asking to calculate anything related to it.
* **Revised thought:** "For the basic TokenAffiliates program, where commission is a fixed percentage..."

By systematically addressing dependencies and ensuring all necessary information is present in each problem statement, the goal of creating self-contained units is achieved. 

### 1. ICO 

 Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for a token called AbundanceCoin.
 The price of the token is determined by a linear bonding curve. Let $P(S)$ represent the price of the token at a given circulating supply $S$. The bonding curve is defined by the equation:

$$P(S) = mS + b$$

where:
*   $S$ is the current circulating supply of AbundanceCoin.
*   $m$ is the slope of the bonding curve, representing the increase in price per token as the supply increases.
*   $b$ is the initial price of the token when the supply is zero.

Determine:

a) Given a specific circulating supply $S$, calculate the price of the AbundanceCoin token, $P(S)$.

b) Calculate the total cost to purchase an additional $\Delta S$ tokens when the current circulating supply is $S$. This involves integrating the price function over the interval $[S, S + \Delta S]$.

**Solution:**

a) The price of the token at supply $S$ is directly given by the bonding curve equation:
   $$P(S) = mS + b$$

b) The cost to purchase $\Delta S$ tokens, starting from a supply $S$, is the integral of the price function from $S$ to $S + \Delta S$:
   $$ \text{Cost} = \int_{S}^{S+\Delta S} P(\sigma) d\sigma = \int_{S}^{S+\Delta S} (m\sigma + b) d\sigma $$
   Solving the integral:
   $$ \text{Cost} = \left[ \frac{1}{2}m\sigma^2 + b\sigma \right]_{S}^{S+\Delta S} $$
   $$ \text{Cost} = \left( \frac{1}{2}m(S+\Delta S)^2 + b(S+\Delta S) \right) - \left( \frac{1}{2}mS^2 + bS \right) $$
   $$ \text{Cost} = \frac{1}{2}m(S^2 + 2S\Delta S + (\Delta S)^2) + bS + b\Delta S - \frac{1}{2}mS^2 - bS $$
   $$ \text{Cost} = mS\Delta S + \frac{1}{2}m(\Delta S)^2 + b\Delta S $$
   $$ \text{Cost} = \frac{1}{2}m(\Delta S)^2 + b\Delta S $$

### 2. Tokenized Economy: Interconnectedness and Dynamics

**Problem Statement:**

Consider a simplified Tokenized Economy consisting of two distinct tokens, Token A and Token B. Each token's price is governed by its own independent linear bonding curve. Let the price of Token A at a circulating supply $S_A$ be $P_A(S_A)$ and the price of Token B at a circulating supply $S_B$ be $P_B(S_B)$, defined as:

*   Price of Token A: $P_A(S_A) = m_A S_A + b_A$
*   Price of Token B: $P_B(S_B) = m_B S_B + b_B$

where $m_A$, $b_A$, $m_B$, and $b_B$ are the slopes and initial prices for Token A and Token B, respectively.

Determine:

a) The exchange rate between Token A and Token B at their current circulating supplies $S_A$ and $S_B$. The exchange rate represents how many units of Token B can be obtained for one unit of Token A.
b) When exchanging $x$ units of Token A for Token B, calculate the approximate quantity of Token B ($y$) that would be minted. Assume the exchange occurs at the current spot prices of both tokens.

**Solution:**

a) The exchange rate between Token A and Token B is the ratio of the price of one unit of Token A to the price of one unit of Token B:
   $$ \text{Exchange Rate (A to B)} = \frac{P_A(S_A)}{P_B(S_B)} = \frac{m_A S_A + b_A}{m_B S_B + b_B} $$

b) When exchanging $x$ units of Token A for Token B, the approximate value obtained by selling Token A is $x \cdot P_A(S_A)$. This value is then used to purchase Token B at its current price $P_B(S_B)$. Therefore, the quantity of Token B ($y$) minted is approximately:
   $$ y \approx \frac{\text{Value of Token A sold}}{\text{Price of Token B}} = \frac{x \cdot P_A(S_A)}{P_B(S_B)} $$
   Substituting the bonding curve equations:
   $$ y \approx x \cdot \frac{m_A S_A + b_A}{m_B S_B + b_B} $$

### 3. TokenAffiliates: Basic and Dynamic Commission Models

**Problem Statement:**

Consider a TokenAffiliates program where individuals can earn commissions by referring investors to purchase tokens.

a) **Basic Commission Model:** In the basic model, affiliates earn a fixed percentage ($\alpha$) of the investment amount ($I$) made through their referral link. Calculate the commission earned ($C$) for a single investment and the total earnings ($E$) for an affiliate based on multiple investments.

b) **Dynamic Commission Model:** In a dynamic model, the commission rate is not fixed but depends on a performance metric ($x$) of the affiliate. Let the commission rate be a function of $x$, denoted as $\alpha(x)$. Calculate the commission earned for a single investment $I$ given a performance metric $x$. Also, propose a general form for an optimization function that could be used to determine the optimal dynamic commission rate.

**Solution:**

a) **Basic Commission Model:**
   *   Commission earned for a single investment:
       $$ C = \alpha \cdot I $$
   *   Total earnings for an affiliate across $n$ investments ($I_1, I_2, ..., I_n$):
       $$ E = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\alpha \cdot I_i) = \alpha \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{n} I_i $$

b) **Dynamic Commission Model:**
   *   Commission earned for a single investment $I$ with a performance metric $x$:
       $$ C(x) = \alpha(x) \cdot I $$
   *   **Optimization Function:** The goal is to find the commission rate function $\alpha(x)$ that maximizes the total earnings of affiliates (or some other objective, like total investment volume) while considering various constraints and the relationship between commission rate and affiliate performance. A general form for the optimization function to maximize expected total earnings for the platform could be:
       $$ \text{Maximize } \sum_{\text{affiliates } k} \sum_{\text{investments } i \text{ by } k} \alpha_k(x_{ki}) \cdot I_{ki} $$
       Where $\alpha_k(x_{ki})$ is the commission rate for affiliate $k$ based on their performance metric for investment $i$, and $I_{ki}$ is the investment amount. Alternatively, to optimize the commission rate offered to all affiliates, assuming a uniform function:
       $$ \text{Maximize } E[\alpha(x)] = \mathbb{E}[\alpha(x) \cdot I(\alpha(x))] $$
       Where the expectation is taken over the distribution of performance metrics and investment amounts, and $I(\alpha(x))$ represents the expected investment volume as a function of the commission rate. Constraints would need to be considered, such as minimum/maximum commission rates and budget limitations.

### 4. Formal Mathematical Model of TokenAffiliates

**Problem Statement:**

Formalize the mathematical model for the TokenAffiliates program, encompassing both basic and dynamic commission structures and considering the possibility of multiple different tokens being offered within the ecosystem.

a) Formulate the model for the basic commission structure where a fixed commission rate is applied to investments.
b) Formulate the model for a dynamic commission structure where the commission rate can vary based on affiliate performance and potentially differ across different tokens.

**Solution:**

a) **Basic Commission Model (Single and Multiple Tokens):**
   *   Let $\alpha_j$ be the fixed commission rate for investments in token $j$.
   *   Let $I_{j,i}$ be the amount of the $i$-th investment made through an affiliate's link in token $j$.
   *   The commission earned by the affiliate for the $i$-th investment in token $j$ is:
       $$ C_{j,i} = \alpha_j \cdot I_{j,i} $$
   *   The total earnings $E$ for an affiliate across all investments in all tokens is the sum of commissions from each investment:
       $$ E = \sum_{j \in J} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} C_{j,i} = \sum_{j \in J} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} (\alpha_j \cdot I_{j,i}) $$
       where $J$ is the set of all tokens and $n_j$ is the number of investments in token $j$ through the affiliate's link.

b) **Dynamic Commission Model (Single and Multiple Tokens):**
   *   Let $\alpha_j(x_k)$ be the dynamic commission rate for token $j$ for affiliate $k$, where $x_k$ represents a performance metric for affiliate $k$. The performance metric could be specific to the token or a general metric.
   *   The commission earned by affiliate $k$ for an investment $I_{j,i}$ in token $j$ is:
       $$ C_{j,i,k} = \alpha_j(x_k) \cdot I_{j,i} $$
   *   The total earnings $E_k$ for affiliate $k$ across all investments in all tokens is:
       $$ E_k = \sum_{j \in J} \sum_{i=1}^{n_{jk}} C_{j,i,k} = \sum_{j \in J} \sum_{i=1}^{n_{jk}} (\alpha_j(x_k) \cdot I_{j,i}) $$
       where $n_{jk}$ is the number of investments in token $j$ through affiliate $k$'s link. Note that the commission rate depends on the affiliate $k$'s performance. A more granular model could have the commission rate depend on the specific investment event.
