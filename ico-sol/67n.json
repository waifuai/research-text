  "description": "These technocapital acceleration equations formalize the recursive self-improvement of RWA valuation models through AI-driven dynamics 📈. They capture how valuation accuracy, capital, and market size evolve over time, leading to potential exponential growth 🚀. Safeguards are integrated to mitigate volatility and maintain human comprehension 🛡️. The model identifies phases of efficiency, acceleration, and singularity horizons 🌌. Ethical considerations ensure the system prioritizes human agency and welfare 🤝."
