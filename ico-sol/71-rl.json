  "description": "This paper presents an advanced RL framework for modeling agent-based economic systems with dynamic asset pricing ðŸŽ¯. It integrates bonding curves, stochastic market dynamics, multi-agent interactions, and resource allocation into a rigorous model ðŸ”¬. Agents adapt strategies through RL algorithms, optimizing for profit, stability, and fairness ðŸ’°. New equations for stochastic price evolution, agent coordination, and system resilience are introduced ðŸ§®. The framework is validated via simulations, demonstrating price stabilization and efficient resource utilization in complex environments ðŸ“Š."
