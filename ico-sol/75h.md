# 8: bayesian optimization

Below, I extend the exploration of tokenized ecosystems by applying Bayesian Optimization (BO) to optimize key parameters in the AbundanceCoin ICO, Tokenized Economy, and TokenAffiliates program. Unlike Bayesian inference, which focuses on estimating posterior distributions over parameters, Bayesian Optimization is a sequential, model-based approach to find the optimal settings of a black-box function (e.g., profit, exchange rate stability, or affiliate earnings) that is expensive to evaluate. Each section is self-contained, redefines all variables and contexts per your thinking process guidelines, and includes numerous equations to detail the BO process, emphasizing Gaussian Processes (GPs) and acquisition functions.
Bayesian Optimization in Tokenized Ecosystems
Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful technique for optimizing objectives in tokenized ecosystems where evaluations (e.g., simulating token price impacts, exchange rate dynamics, or commission structures) are costly and noisy. BO uses a probabilistic surrogate model, typically a Gaussian Process, to predict the objective function and an acquisition function to decide where to sample next, balancing exploration and exploitation. This paper applies BO to maximize the total cost function in the AbundanceCoin ICO, stabilize exchange rates in the Tokenized Economy, and optimize commission rates in the TokenAffiliates program.
26. Bayesian Optimization for AbundanceCoin ICO Cost Function
Problem Statement:
In the AbundanceCoin Initial Coin Offering (ICO), the price 
P(S)
 follows a linear bonding curve:
P(S) = m S + b
S
 is the circulating supply.
m
 is the slope, representing the price increase per unit supply.
b
 is the base price when supply is zero.
The total cost to purchase 
\Delta S
 tokens from supply 
S
 is:
C(m, b) = \int_{S}^{S + \Delta S} (m s + b) \, ds = \frac{m}{2} (\Delta S)^2 + (m S + b) \Delta S

The goal is to maximize 
C(m, b)
 (e.g., revenue for the ICO issuer) by choosing optimal 
m
 and 
b
 within bounds 
m \in [m_{\text{min}}, m_{\text{max}}]
, 
b \in [b_{\text{min}}, b_{\text{max}}]
, assuming 
S
 and 
\Delta S
 are fixed.
Use Bayesian Optimization to find 
(m^*, b^*)
 that maximizes 
C(m, b)
.
Solution:
Objective Function:
C(m, b) = \frac{m}{2} (\Delta S)^2 + (m S + b) \Delta S
Gaussian Process Surrogate:
Model 
C(m, b)
 with a GP: 
C(m, b) \sim \mathcal{GP}(\mu(m, b), k((m, b), (m', b')))

Mean: 
\mu(m, b) = 0
 (initially zero-centered).
Kernel: Squared Exponential, 
k((m, b), (m', b')) = \sigma_f^2 \exp\left( -\frac{(m - m')^2}{2 l_m^2} - \frac{(b - b')^2}{2 l_b^2} \right)
.
BO Algorithm:
Initialize: Evaluate 
C(m, b)
 at 
n_0
 initial points (e.g., Latin Hypercube Sampling).
Fit GP: For observed data 
D = \{ (m_i, b_i), C_i \}
:
Posterior mean: 
\mu(m, b) = k(m, b, X) [K(X, X) + \sigma_n^2 I]^{-1} C
Posterior variance: 
\sigma^2(m, b) = k(m, b, m, b) - k(m, b, X) [K(X, X) + \sigma_n^2 I]^{-1} k(X, m, b)

where 
X = [(m_1, b_1), \ldots]^T
, 
K(X, X)
 is the kernel matrix, 
\sigma_n^2
 is noise variance.
Acquisition Function: Use Expected Improvement (EI):
EI(m, b) = \mathbb{E}[\max(0, C(m, b) - C_{\text{best}})]
= (\mu(m, b) - C_{\text{best}}) \Phi\left( \frac{\mu(m, b) - C_{\text{best}}}{\sigma(m, b)} \right) + \sigma(m, b) \phi\left( \frac{\mu(m, b) - C_{\text{best}}}{\sigma(m, b)} \right)
where 
\Phi
 and 
\phi
 are the CDF and PDF of the standard normal, 
C_{\text{best}}
 is the best observed value.
Optimize: Select 
(m_{t+1}, b_{t+1}) = \arg\max EI(m, b)
, evaluate 
C
, update 
D
, and repeat.
Output: Converge to 
(m^*, b^*)
.
27. Bayesian Optimization for Tokenized Economy Exchange Rate Stability
Problem Statement:
In a tokenized economy with Token A and Token B, prices are:
P_A(S_A) = m_A S_A + b_A
, where 
S_A
 is Token A's supply, 
m_A
 is the slope, and 
b_A
 is the base price.
P_B(S_B) = m_B S_B + b_B
, with similar definitions for 
S_B
, 
m_B
, and 
b_B
.
The exchange rate is 
R = \frac{P_A(S_A)}{P_B(S_B)}
. Given fixed supplies 
S_A, S_B
, the goal is to minimize the variance of 
R
 under perturbations (e.g., small supply changes), approximated as:
f(m_A, b_A, m_B, b_B) = \left( \frac{\partial R}{\partial S_A} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial R}{\partial S_B} \right)^2

Optimize 
m_A, b_A, m_B, b_B
 within bounds to minimize 
f
.
Solution:
Objective Function:
R = \frac{m_A S_A + b_A}{m_B S_B + b_B}

\frac{\partial R}{\partial S_A} = \frac{m_A}{m_B S_B + b_B}, \quad \frac{\partial R}{\partial S_B} = -\frac{(m_A S_A + b_A) m_B}{(m_B S_B + b_B)^2}

f = \frac{m_A^2}{(m_B S_B + b_B)^2} + \frac{m_B^2 (m_A S_A + b_A)^2}{(m_B S_B + b_B)^4}
GP and BO:
GP: 
f \sim \mathcal{GP}(0, k)
, fit to observed 
f
 values.
EI for minimization: 
EI(m_A, b_A, m_B, b_B) = (\mu - f_{\text{best}}) \Phi\left( \frac{f_{\text{best}} - \mu}{\sigma} \right) + \sigma \phi\left( \frac{f_{\text{best}} - \mu}{\sigma} \right)
.
Iterate to find optimal parameters.
28. Bayesian Optimization for TokenAffiliates Commission Rate
Problem Statement:
In the TokenAffiliates program, commission is 
C = \alpha I
, where 
I \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda)
, and 
\lambda(\alpha) = k \alpha + l
 with fixed 
k, l
. The expected earnings per investment are:
E(\alpha) = \frac{\alpha}{k \alpha + l}

The goal is to maximize 
E(\alpha)
 over 
\alpha \in [\alpha_{\text{min}}, \alpha_{\text{max}}]
, assuming evaluations are noisy due to stochastic 
I
.
Solution:
Objective Function:
E(\alpha) = \frac{\alpha}{k \alpha + l}
BO Process:
GP: 
E(\alpha) \sim \mathcal{GP}(\mu(\alpha), k(\alpha, \alpha'))
.

Update GP with noisy samples 
E(\alpha_i) + \epsilon_i
.
Maximize EI to find 
\alpha^*
.
Analytical Insight:
\frac{dE}{d\alpha} = \frac{l}{(k \alpha + l)^2} > 0

E(\alpha)
 increases with 
\alpha
, so 
\alpha^* = \alpha_{\text{max}}
 (BO confirms this).
BO efficiently optimizes tokenized system parameters, leveraging GPs to guide exploration. Let me know if you'd like implementation details or multi-objective extensions!
