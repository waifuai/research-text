  "link": "./39b.md",
  "description": "This paper transforms a Python simulation into an unsolved mathematical problem, modeling token airdrop strategies in economies. 📝 It defines user behaviors through sigmoid probabilities influenced by price sensitivities and market sentiment. 🔢 Various airdrop types— uniform, lottery, tiered—are mathematically analyzed for their impact on supply and price evolution. 🎲 Vesting mechanisms like linear and dynamic are formulated to predict long-term token dynamics. ⏳"
