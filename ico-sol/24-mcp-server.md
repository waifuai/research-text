# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server Implementation

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server serves as the backbone for managing secure and scalable resource access within the ContextCoin (CTX) ecosystem on Solana. This server facilitates the integration between resource providers and consumers, enforcing micro-payments via CTX tokens to mitigate spam, DDoS threats, and ensure a decentralized, accountable network.

## Architecture

The MCP server is designed using a modular architecture with components for resource registration, access request handling, and token transaction verification. Running as a Solana-based application, it interfaces with the blockchain through Solana Web3.js or Rust libraries, ensuring low-latency operations. Key modules include:

- **Resource Registry:** A secure database for storing resource metadata, access fees, and provider information.
- **Access Controller:** Handles incoming requests, validates CTX payments, and grants or denies access based on availability and funds.
- **Blockchain Integrator:** Manages interactions with Solana smart contracts, including token transfers and state updates.

## Implementation

The server is implemented in Rust for performance and compatibility with Solana. It exposes a RESTful API with endpoints for:

- Registering new resources `/resource/register`
- Requesting access `/resource/access/{id}`
- Checking payment status `/payment/status/{id}`

All communications are encrypted, and rate limiting is applied dynamically based on traffic patterns. The server utilizes Solana's high throughput to process thousands of accesses per second.

## Security Considerations

To prevent exploitation, the server incorporates:

- Cryptographic verification of transactions.
- Honeypot traps for malicious users.
- Regular audits of resource logs to flag suspicious behavior.

By tying resource access directly to provable payments, the MCP server ensures that only legitimate users can interact with the system, fostering a sustainable decentralized marketplace.

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include AI-driven fee adjustments, multi-chain support, and advanced analytics for resource usage patterns. The server aims to scale horizontally while maintaining the core principles of security and decentralization.
