  "link": "./52-emergent.md",
  "description": "This paper investigates autonomous AI agents in Project Genesis, focusing on their learning and adaptation via reinforcement learning. 🤖 It analyzes emergent behaviors like price discovery, market stability, and wealth distribution. 📊 Simulations demonstrate how agents use DQN to optimize trading strategies in dynamic environments. 🔄 Increasing intelligence leads to strategic interactions, exploiting efficiencies but risking instability. ⚠️ The framework highlights implications for AI-driven economies, balancing efficiency with fairness challenges. ⚖️"
