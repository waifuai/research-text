Continuation Paper: Advanced Models and Dynamics in Tokenized Ecosystems
This paper extends the mathematical exploration of tokenized systems initially outlined in the study of AbundanceCoin's Initial Coin Offering (ICO), Tokenized Economy dynamics, and TokenAffiliates commission structures. Here, we introduce advanced models that incorporate market volatility, arbitrage opportunities, and multi-token staking mechanisms. Each problem statement is self-contained, with all variables and contexts explicitly defined within its scope, ensuring clarity and independence.
5. Volatility-Adjusted Bonding Curve for AbundanceCoin
Problem Statement:
Consider the AbundanceCoin token, where the price is determined by a bonding curve in an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Unlike the simple linear model, market volatility now influences the token price dynamically. Define the price of AbundanceCoin at circulating supply 
S
 as 
P(S, t)
, where 
t
 represents time, and volatility is modeled through a stochastic term. The volatility-adjusted bonding curve is given by:
P(S, t) = m S + b + \sigma W(t)
where:
S
 is the current circulating supply of AbundanceCoin.
m
 is the slope of the linear bonding curve, representing the price increase per unit of supply.
b
 is the base price when supply is zero.
\sigma
 is the volatility coefficient, measuring the amplitude of price fluctuations.
W(t)
 is a Wiener process (standard Brownian motion), introducing randomness with 
W(t) \sim N(0, t)
.
Determine:
a) The expected price of AbundanceCoin at time 
t
 given a supply 
S
.
b) The total expected cost to purchase an additional 
\Delta S
 tokens at time 
t
, accounting for the stochastic nature of the price.
Solution:
a) Expected Price:
 Since 
W(t)
 is a Wiener process with mean zero (
\mathbb{E}[W(t)] = 0
), the expected price at time 
t
 is:
 
$ \mathbb{E}[P(S, t)] = \mathbb{E}[m S + b + \sigma W(t)] = m S + b + \sigma \cdot 0 = m S + b $
 
 Thus, the stochastic term does not shift the expected price from the deterministic linear model.
b) Expected Cost:
 The cost to purchase 
\Delta S
 tokens from supply 
S
 to 
S + \Delta S
 at time 
t
 is the integral of the price function over the supply interval:
 
\text{Cost}(S, \Delta S, t) = \int_{S}^{S + \Delta S} P(u, t) \, du = \int_{S}^{S + \Delta S} (m u + b + \sigma W(t)) \, du
 
 Since 
W(t)
 is constant with respect to supply 
u
 at a fixed time 
t
, compute the integral:
 
\text{Cost}(S, \Delta S, t) = \int_{S}^{S + \Delta S} (m u + b) \, du + \int_{S}^{S + \Delta S} \sigma W(t) \, du
First term:
\int_{S}^{S + \Delta S} (m u + b) \, du = \left[ \frac{m u^2}{2} + b u \right]_{S}^{S + \Delta S} = \left( \frac{m (S + \Delta S)^2}{2} + b (S + \Delta S) \right) - \left( \frac{m S^2}{2} + b S \right)
= \frac{m}{2} (S^2 + 2 S \Delta S + (\Delta S)^2) + b S + b \Delta S - \frac{m S^2}{2} - b S = \frac{m}{2} (\Delta S)^2 + m S \Delta S + b \Delta S
Second term:
\int_{S}^{S + \Delta S} \sigma W(t) \, du = \sigma W(t) \int_{S}^{S + \Delta S} 1 \, du = \sigma W(t) \cdot (S + \Delta S - S) = \sigma W(t) \cdot \Delta S
 Thus:
 
\text{Cost}(S, \Delta S, t) = \frac{m}{2} (\Delta S)^2 + m S \Delta S + b \Delta S + \sigma W(t) \Delta S
 
 Taking the expectation:
 
\mathbb{E}[\text{Cost}(S, \Delta S, t)] = \frac{m}{2} (\Delta S)^2 + m S \Delta S + b \Delta S + \sigma \cdot 0 \cdot \Delta S = \frac{m}{2} (\Delta S)^2 + (m S + b) \Delta S
6. Arbitrage in a Multi-Token Economy
Problem Statement:
In a tokenized economy with two tokens, Token A and Token B, each follows a linear bonding curve. Define their prices as:
Price of Token A: 
P_A(S_A) = m_A S_A + b_A
, where 
S_A
 is the circulating supply, 
m_A
 is the slope, and 
b_A
 is the base price.
Price of Token B: 
P_B(S_B) = m_B S_B + b_B
, with similar definitions for 
S_B
, 
m_B
, and 
b_B
.
An arbitrage opportunity arises if an external decentralized exchange (DEX) offers a different exchange rate than the bonding curve ratio. Let the DEX exchange rate be 
R_{\text{DEX}}
 (units of Token B per Token A), while the bonding curve exchange rate is 
R_{\text{BC}} = \frac{P_A(S_A)}{P_B(S_B)}
.
Determine:
a) The condition under which arbitrage is profitable.
b) The profit from converting 
x
 units of Token A to Token B via the DEX and then redeeming Token B back to the bonding curve system, assuming no transaction fees.
Solution:
a) Arbitrage Condition:
 Arbitrage is profitable if the DEX exchange rate differs from the bonding curve rate:
If 
R_{\text{DEX}} > R_{\text{BC}}
, buy Token B with Token A on the DEX and redeem Token B via its bonding curve.
If 
R_{\text{DEX}} < R_{\text{BC}}
, buy Token A with Token B on the DEX and redeem Token A via its bonding curve.
 Define 
R_{\text{BC}} = \frac{m_A S_A + b_A}{m_B S_B + b_B}
. Profitability requires 
R_{\text{DEX}} \neq R_{\text{BC}}
.
b) Profit Calculation (Case: 
R_{\text{DEX}} > R_{\text{BC}}
):
Sell 
x
 Token A on the DEX to get 
y = x \cdot R_{\text{DEX}}
 Token B.
Redeem 
y
 Token B via the bonding curve. The value received is the integral of 
P_B(S_B)
 as supply decreases from 
S_B
 to 
S_B - y
:
\text{Value} = \int_{S_B - y}^{S_B} P_B(u) \, du = \int_{S_B - y}^{S_B} (m_B u + b_B) \, du
= \left[ \frac{m_B u^2}{2} + b_B u \right]_{S_B - y}^{S_B} = \left( \frac{m_B S_B^2}{2} + b_B S_B \right) - \left( \frac{m_B (S_B - y)^2}{2} + b_B (S_B - y) \right)
= \frac{m_B}{2} (S_B^2 - (S_B^2 - 2 S_B y + y^2)) + b_B (S_B - (S_B - y))
= \frac{m_B}{2} (2 S_B y - y^2) + b_B y = m_B S_B y - \frac{m_B y^2}{2} + b_B y
Cost of 
x
 Token A via its bonding curve:
\text{Cost} = x \cdot P_A(S_A) = x (m_A S_A + b_A)
Profit:
\text{Profit} = m_B S_B (x R_{\text{DEX}}) - \frac{m_B (x R_{\text{DEX}})^2}{2} + b_B (x R_{\text{DEX}}) - x (m_A S_A + b_A)
7. Staking Rewards in a Tokenized Ecosystem
Problem Statement:
In a tokenized ecosystem, holders of Token A can stake their tokens to earn rewards in Token B. Define:
S_A
 as the total supply of Token A, and 
Q_A
 as the amount staked.
P_A(S_A) = m_A S_A + b_A
 as the price of Token A.
P_B(S_B) = m_B S_B + b_B
 as the price of Token B, where 
S_B
 is Token B's supply.
Reward rate 
r
 (units of Token B per unit of Token A staked per unit time).
Determine:
a) The total reward 
R
 in Token B earned over time 
T
 for staking 
Q_A
 Token A.
b) The value of rewards in terms of Token A at current prices after time 
T
.
Solution:
a) Total Reward:
 The reward rate 
r
 gives Token B per unit of Token A staked per unit time. For 
Q_A
 staked over time 
T
:
 
R = r Q_A T
b) Value in Token A:
 The value of 
R
 Token B in terms of Token B's price is 
R \cdot P_B(S_B)
. Convert this to Token A using the exchange rate:
 
\text{Value in Token A} = \frac{R \cdot P_B(S_B)}{P_A(S_A)} = \frac{r Q_A T (m_B S_B + b_B)}{m_A S_A + b_A}
